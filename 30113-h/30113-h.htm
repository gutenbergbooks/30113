<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A GENTLEMAN RANKER</h3>
</div>
<p>Dan McLagan shifted his cigar, and his face lit with a
grin of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five per cent, of calves,&rdquo; he murmured, glancing
out at the sunlit yards. &ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s been an elegant
round-up.&rdquo; Then his enthusiasm rose and found expression.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the finest, luckiest ranch in Montana&ndash;&ndash;in the
country. Guess I&rsquo;d be within my rights if I said &lsquo;in the
world.&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t say more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet monosyllable brought the rancher down to
earth. He looked round at his companion with an inquiring
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim Thorpe had no further comment to offer.</p>
<p>The two were sitting in the foreman&rsquo;s cabin, a small
but roughly comfortable split-log hut, where elegance and
tidiness had place only in the more delicate moments of
its occupant&rsquo;s retrospective imagination. Its furnishing
belonged to the fashion of the prevailing industry, and
had in its manufacture the utilitarian methods of the
Western plains, rather than the more skilled workmanship
of the furniture used in civilization. Thus, the bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
was a stretcher supported on two packing-cases, the
table had four solid legs that had once formed the sides
of a third packing-case, while the cupboard, full of cattle
medicines, was the reconstructed portions of a fourth
packing-case.</p>
<p>The collected art on the walls consisted of two rareties.
One was a torn print of a woman&rsquo;s figure, classically
indecent with regard to apparel; and the other was a
fly-disfigured portrait of a sweet-faced old lady, whose
refinement and dignity of expression suggested surroundings
of a far more delicate nature than those in which
she now found herself. Besides these, a brace of ivory-butted
revolvers served to ornament the wall at the head
of the bed. And a stack of five or six repeating rifles
littered an adjacent corner.</p>
<p>It was a man&rsquo;s abode, and the very simplicity of it, the
lack of cheap ornamentation, the carelessness of self in it,
suggested a great deal of the occupant&rsquo;s character. Jim
Thorpe cared as little for creature comforts as only a
healthy-minded, healthy-bodied man, who has tasted of
the best and passed the dish&ndash;&ndash;or has had it snatched
from him&ndash;&ndash;will sometimes care. His thoughts were of
the moment. He dared not look behind him; and
ahead?&ndash;&ndash;well, as yet, he had no desire to think too far
ahead.</p>
<p>The ranch owner was sitting on the side of the
stretcher, and Jim Thorpe, his foreman, stood leaning
against the table. McLagan&rsquo;s Irish face, his squat figure
and powerful head were a combination suggesting tremendous
energy and determination, rather than any
great mental power, and in this he strongly contrasted
with the refined, thoughtful face of his foreman.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>But then, in almost every characteristic the Irishman
differed from his employee. While Jim&rsquo;s word was never
questioned even by the veriest sceptic of the plains,
McLagan was notoriously the greatest, most optimistic
liar in the state of Montana. A reputation that required
some niceness of proficiency to retain.</p>
<p>McLagan&rsquo;s ranch was known as the &ldquo;AZ&rsquo;s.&rdquo; It was a
brand selected to illuminate his opinion of his own undertakings.
He said that his ranch must be the beginning
and end of all things in the cattle world, and he was
proud of the ingenuity in his selection of a brand. The
less cultured folk, who, perhaps, had more humor than
respect for the Irishman, found his brand tripped much
more easily off the tongue by replacing the Z with an S,
and invariably using the plural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jim,&rdquo; the rancher went on, buoyed with his own
enthusiasm, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a great round-up. Seventy-five
per cent. Bully! I&rsquo;ll open out my scheme. Listen.
Ther&rsquo;s Donagh&rsquo;s land buttin&rsquo; on us. Thirty sections.
They got stations for 10,000 head of stock. We&rsquo;ll buy
&rsquo;em right out of business. See? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to turn those
stations into double. That slice of land will carry me
backing right up into the foot-hills, which means shelter
for my stock in winter. See? Then I&rsquo;ll rent off a dozen
or more homesteads for a supply of grain and hay.
You know I hate to blow hot air around, but I say right
here I&rsquo;m going to help myself to a mighty big cinch on
Montana, and then&ndash;&ndash;why, I&rsquo;ll lay right on the heels of
Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked for approval into the bronzed face of his
companion. But Thorpe hesitated, while a shadowy
smile lurked in his clear, dark eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he observed, with a suspicious quietness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; added the other, to clinch what he believed to
be his companion&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher stirred uneasily. The tone of Thorpe&rsquo;s
inquiry suggested doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; McLagan repeated uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when you&rsquo;ve got all this, and you&rsquo;re the biggest
producer in the country, the beef folk in Chicago &rsquo;ll beat
you down to their price, and the automobile folk will cut
the ground clear from under your horses&rsquo; feet. You
won&rsquo;t hit Congress, because you won&rsquo;t have the dollars
to buy your graft with. Then, when you&rsquo;re left with
nothing to round-up but a bunch of gophers, the government
will come along and have you seen to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Irishman&rsquo;s face grew scarlet, and he began to
splutter, but Jim Thorpe went on mercilessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, boss. We&rsquo;re cattlemen, both of us.
You&rsquo;ve grown up to cattle, and I&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;ve acquired
the habit, I guess. But cut it out, and put your change
into automobiles. They aren&rsquo;t things to breed with, I
guess. But I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;d raise a dust there&rsquo;s more
dollars in than there&rsquo;s beans in our supper hash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher&rsquo;s swift anger had gone. He shook his head,
and his hard, blue eyes stared out through the doorway
at the busy life beyond. He could see the lines of buildings
packed close together, as though huddling up for
companionship in that wide, lonesome world of grass.
He could see the acres and acres of corrals, outlying, a
rampart to the ranch buildings. Then, beyond that, the
barbed wire fencing, miles and miles of it. He could see
horsemen moving about, engaged upon their day&rsquo;s work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
He could hear the lowing of the cattle in the corrals.
As Thorpe had said, he had grown up to cattle. Cattle
and horses were his life.</p>
<p>He was rich now. This was all his. He was growing
richer every year, and&ndash;&ndash;Thorpe was prophesying the
slump, the end. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it, or rather he
wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. And he turned with a fierce expression
of blind loyalty to his calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To h&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; with automobiles! It&rsquo;s cattle for me.
Cattle or bust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorpe shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no alternative, boss. I can see it all coming.
Everybody can&ndash;&ndash;if they look. There&rsquo;s nothing between
grain farming and&ndash;&ndash;automobiles. The land here is too
rich to waste on cattle. There&rsquo;s plenty other land elsewhere
that&rsquo;ll feed stock, but wouldn&rsquo;t raise a carrot.
Psha! There won&rsquo;t be need for horses to plough, or
even haul grain; and you&rsquo;ve got 15,000 head. It&rsquo;ll be
all automobiles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d &lsquo;scrap&rsquo; the lot!&rdquo; added the Irishman, briefly and
feelingly. Then he glanced at his companion out of the
tail of his eye. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s your education, boy.
That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with you. Your head&rsquo;s running
wheels. You come into cattle too late. You&rsquo;ve got
city doings down your backbone, and I guess you need
weeding bad. Say, you&rsquo;re a West Point man, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorpe seemed to shrink at the question. He turned
aside, and his eyes rested for a moment on the portrait
nailed upon his wall. It was only for a moment his dark
eyes encountered the tender old eyes that looked out at
him from the faded picture. Then he looked again at
the owner of the &ldquo;AZ&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and gave him a smiling nod.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, boss. I intended to go into the engineers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;ve all been soldiers, since way back when
my folks came over with the first lot from England.
Guess I&rsquo;m the first&ndash;&ndash;backslider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. You ain&rsquo;t a backslider, Jim Thorpe. I sure
wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Not on my life. Guess you&rsquo;re the
victim of a cow-headed government that reckons to make
soldiers by arithmetic, an&rsquo; wastin&rsquo; ink makin&rsquo; fool answers
to a sight more fool questions. Gee, when I hit Congress,
I&rsquo;ll make some one holler &lsquo;help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman&rsquo;s smile broadened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t exams, boss,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d got a
cinch on them, and they were mostly past cutting any
ice with me. It was&ndash;&ndash;well, it don&rsquo;t matter now.&rdquo; He
paused, and his eyes settled again on the portrait. The
Irishman waited, and presently Jim turned from the picture,
and his quizzical smile encountered the hard blue
eyes of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said just now my head was full of wheels,&rdquo; he
began, with a humorous light in his eyes that was yet not
without sadness. &ldquo;Maybe it is&ndash;&ndash;maybe it has reason to
be. You see, it was an automobile that finished my career
at West Point. My mother came by her death in one.
An accident. Automobiles were immature then&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;well,
her income died with her, and I had to quit and hustle
in a new direction. Curiously enough I went into the
works of an automobile enterprise. I&ndash;&ndash;I hated the things,
but they fascinated me. I made good there, and got
together a fat wad of bills, which was useful seeing I had
my young cousin&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;you know, young Will Henderson, of
Barnriff; he&rsquo;s a trapper now&ndash;&ndash;education on my hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Just as things were good and dollars were coming plenty
the enterprise bust. I was out&ndash;&ndash;plumb out. I hunched
up for another kick. I had a dandy patent that was to do
big things. I got together a syndicate to run it. I&rsquo;d got
a big car built to demonstrate my patent, and it represented
all I had in the world. It was to be on the race-track.
Say, she didn&rsquo;t demonstrate worth a cent. My syndicate
jibbed, and I&ndash;&ndash;well, here I am, a cattleman&ndash;&ndash;you see
cattle haven&rsquo;t the speed of automobiles, but they mostly
do what&rsquo;s expected. That&rsquo;s my yarn, boss. You didn&rsquo;t
know much of me. It&rsquo;s not a great yarn as life goes.
Mostly ordinary. But there&rsquo;s a deal of life in it, in its
way. There&rsquo;s a pile of hope busted, and hope busted isn&rsquo;t
a pleasant thing. Makes you think a deal. However,
Will Henderson and I&ndash;&ndash;we can&rsquo;t kick a lot when you
look around. I&rsquo;m earning a good wage, and I&rsquo;ve got a
tidy job&ndash;&ndash;that don&rsquo;t look like quitting. And Will&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
netting eighty a month out of his pelts. After all things
don&rsquo;t much count, do they? Fifty or sixty years hence
our doings won&rsquo;t cut any ice. We&rsquo;re down, out, and
nature shuts out memory. That&rsquo;s the best of it. We
shan&rsquo;t know anything. We&rsquo;ll have forgotten everything
we ever did know. We shan&rsquo;t be haunted by the &lsquo;might-have-beens&rsquo;.
We shall have no regrets. It&rsquo;ll just be
sleep, a long, long sleep&ndash;&ndash;and forgetfulness. And then&ndash;&ndash;ah,
well, boss, I&rsquo;m yarning a heap, and the boys are
out on the fences with no one to see they&rsquo;re not shooting
&lsquo;craps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher turned to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to the fences meself,&rdquo; he said, shortly.
Then he went on: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dozen an&rsquo; more three-year-olds
in the corrals needs bustin&rsquo;. You best set two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
o&rsquo; the boys on &rsquo;em. Ther&rsquo;s a black mare among &rsquo;em.
I&rsquo;ll get you to handle her yourself. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ride her,
an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t want no fool broncho-buster tearing her mouth
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-ho, boss.&rdquo; Jim was smiling happily at the
man&rsquo;s broad back as he stood facing out of the door.
&ldquo;But, if you&rsquo;ve half a minute, I&rsquo;ve got something else to
get through me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; McLagan turned. His Irish face was alight
with sudden interest. &ldquo;Guess I ain&rsquo;t busy fer ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than enough,&rdquo; said Jim, readily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about that land I was speaking to you of the other day.
I told you those things about myself&ndash;&ndash;because of that.
As I said, you didn&rsquo;t know much of me, except my work
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan nodded, and chewed the end of his cigar.
His keen eyes were studying the other&rsquo;s face. At last he
removed his cigar, and spat out a bit of tobacco leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all I need to,&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;The proposition
was one hundred and sixty acres for a homestead,
with grazin&rsquo; rights. You want a lease. Gettin&rsquo;
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might happen that way,&rdquo; grinned the foreman
somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found the leddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marryin&rsquo;s a fool game anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I don&rsquo;t want wimmin-folk in mine. You&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to hold your job?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You see, boss&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Jim began to explain.</p>
<p>But McLagan broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have it for rent, boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It suits
me, if you don&rsquo;t mean quittin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean quitting,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run
it with a hired man. Y&rsquo;see I&rsquo;ve got one hundred and fifty
stock and a bit saved for building. When I get married
my wife&rsquo;ll see to things some. See the work is done
while I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you didn&rsquo;t seem like gettin&rsquo; married jest now,
talkin&rsquo; of those things. You kind o&rsquo; seemed &lsquo;down&rsquo;
some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes became thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes you feel &lsquo;down&rsquo; when you get remembering
some things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;see it makes you wonder what
the future feels like doing in the way of kicks. Things
are going good about now, and&ndash;&ndash;and I want &rsquo;em to keep
on going good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan laughed boisterously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure jest got to play hard to-day, let the future
worry fer itself. Well, so long. I&rsquo;ll hand you the papers
when you&rsquo;ve selected the ground, boy. An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t forget
the black mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the hut and Jim watched him stumping busily
away across to the big barn where the saddle horses were
kept. His eyes were smiling as he looked after him. He
liked Dan McLagan. His volcanic temper; his immoderate
manner of expression suggested an open enough
disposition, and he liked men to be like that.</p>
<p>But his smile was at the thought that somehow he had
managed to make his &ldquo;boss&rdquo; think that extreme caution
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
was one of his characteristics. Yes, it made him smile.
If such had been the case many things in the past, many
disasters might have been averted.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact he had been thinking of the woman
he hoped to make his wife. He was wondering if he had
a reasonable prospect of helping her to all the comfort in
life she deserved. He took an ultra serious view of
matrimonial responsibilities. Eve must have a good,
ample home. She must have nothing to worry, none
of little petty economies to study which make life so
burdensome. Yes, they must start with that, and then,
with luck, their stock would grow, he would buy more
land, and finally she would be able to hold her place with
the wives of all the richest ranchers in the district.
That was what he wanted for her when they were
married.</p>
<p>When they were married. Suddenly he laughed. He
had not asked her yet. Still&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; His eyes grew
gloomy. His thoughts turned to another man, his cousin,
Will Henderson. He knew that Will liked Eve Marsham.
It was the one cloud upon his horizon. Will
was younger than he by a good deal. He was handsome,
too. Eve liked him. Yes, she liked him, he was
sure. But somehow he did not associate marriage with
Will. Well,&ndash;&ndash;it was no good seeking trouble.</p>
<p>He pushed his thoughts aside and stood up. But the
cloud upon his dark face was not so easily got rid of.
How could it be? for Eve Marsham meant the whole
world to him.</p>
<p>He moved toward the door, and as he looked out at the
sunlit yards he started. A horseman had just come into
view round the corner of one of the barns. But though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
his smile was lacking when the man came up and drew
rein at his door, there was no mistaking the kindly
cordiality of his greeting as he held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Will,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real glad you&rsquo;ve come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_II_A_SHOOTING_MATCH' id='CHAPTER_II_A_SHOOTING_MATCH'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A SHOOTING MATCH</h3>
</div>
<p>In silence the two men sat smoking. Will Henderson,
half sitting, half lying on the stretcher-bed, gazed out
through the doorway at the distant mountain peaks.
His hands were clasped behind his head, and a sullen, preoccupied
look was in his eyes. Jim Thorpe was sitting,
frog-fashion, on an upturned soap-box, watching him.
His eyes were a shade anxious, but full of good feeling.</p>
<p>Jim was nine years his cousin&rsquo;s senior, and Will was
twenty-four. They were really almost foster-brothers,
for from the younger man&rsquo;s earliest days he had lived
with Jim, in the care of the latter&rsquo;s widowed mother.
He was an orphan, both his parents having died before
he was two years old, and so it was that he had been
adopted by Jim&rsquo;s mother, the child&rsquo;s only living relative.
For years Jim had lavished on him an elder brother&rsquo;s
affection and care. And when his own mother died, and
he was left to his own resources, it still made no difference.
Will must share in everything. Will&rsquo;s education
must be completed adequately, for that was Jim&rsquo;s nature.
His duty and inclination lay straight ahead of him, and
he carried both out to the end. Perhaps he did more.
Perhaps he overindulged and spoiled the youngster of
whom he was so fond. Anyway, as in many similar
cases, Will accepted all as his right, and gave very little
in return. He was selfish, passionate, and his temper
was not always a nice one.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>In appearance there was a striking resemblance between
these two. Not in face, but in figure, in coloring, in
general style. A back view of them was identical. In
face they differed enormously. They were both extremely
handsome, but of utterly different types. Jim was classically
regular of feature, while Will possessed all the
irregularity and brightness of his Hibernian ancestry.
Both were dark; dark hair, dark eyes, dark eyebrows.
In fact, so alike were they in general appearance that, in
their New York days, they had been known by their
intimates as the &ldquo;twins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just now there was something troubling. And that
something seemed to be worrying Will Henderson even
more than his cousin. At least, to judge by outward
appearances. He showed it in his expression, which was
somewhat savage. He showed it in his nervous, impatient
movements, in the manner in which he smoked.
Jim had seen it at once, and understood. And he, too,
was troubled.</p>
<p>They had been silent some time, and eventually it was
Jim who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, lad. Let&rsquo;s have it out,&rdquo; he said, decidedly.</p>
<p>His voice was full and strong, and kindly.</p>
<p>The other stirred, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your busy time, Will,&rdquo; Jim went on. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t come away from those hills yonder to pass the
time of day with me. You came because something
wouldn&rsquo;t let you rest. I know you, boy; I know you.
Something&rsquo;s troubling that mind of yours in a way that
makes it hard for you to speak, even now you&rsquo;re here.
Shall I try and begin it for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>There was infinite kindness in the man&rsquo;s tone. There
was a smile in his eyes that might well have drawn a
responsive smile from even an angry child.</p>
<p>Will removed his pipe, but the responsive smile was
not forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open out, Jim,&rdquo; he said coldly.</p>
<p>The other waited. The smoke of their pipes rolled
up on the still, warm air of the room, upsetting the
calculations of a few mischievously busy mosquitoes.
The sun shone in through the doorway. The ranch was
quiet now. All the &ldquo;hands&rdquo; had departed to their
work, and only the occasional lowing of a solitary milch
cow in one of the corrals, and the trampling feet of the
horses waiting to be &ldquo;broken,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;yeps&rdquo; of a few
mouching dogs, afforded any sign of life outside in the
ranch yards.</p>
<p>Jim began to grow restive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boy: I&rsquo;ve some &lsquo;breaking&rsquo; to do. Maybe
you&rsquo;ll come along. You can talk as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half rose, but Will sat up in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Jim,&rdquo; he said, almost roughly. Then his
tone changed in a way through which his mercurial disposition
spoke. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;whatever
happens in the future, I&rsquo;d like you to understand that all
you&rsquo;ve done for me in the past counts for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s real serious, lad?&rdquo; Jim smiled back at
him. But he failed to catch his eye. Then he, too,
changed his manner, and there was a sudden coolness in
it. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t recite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anything I&rsquo;ve done
has been a&ndash;&ndash;a pleasure to me. Our ways have lain a bit
apart for some months, but it makes no difference to my
feelings, except to make me regret it. The fortunes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
war, eh? And a fair bit of grist is rolling into our
separate mills. Honest grist. We&rsquo;re good friends, lad&ndash;&ndash;so
let&rsquo;s have it. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of the word, &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; Will seemed
to utterly freeze up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;a woman,&rdquo; he said frigidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve Marsham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim sighed. He knew there were breakers ahead.
Breakers which must be faced, and faced sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love her?&rdquo; There was a dryness in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t live without her. She is my whole
world. She is more than that. God! How I love
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s darkly brilliant eyes were on the younger man&rsquo;s
face. They compelled his gaze, and the two men looked
long at each other, vainly trying to penetrate to that
which lay behind. It was Will who turned away at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he said, and there was no longer any
pretense of cordiality in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tense moment for both men; and tremendous
in its possibilities. There was no shrinking in either now;
no yielding. But, as it ever was, Jim took the lead after
a few moments&rsquo; silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;does she love you?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>His words were little above a whisper, but so tense was
his feeling that his voice seemed to cut through the still
air of the room. Will hesitated before replying. Perhaps
he was reckoning up Jim&rsquo;s chances as compared with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
own. Finally, he was reluctantly compelled to make an
admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other sighed audibly. Then he mechanically began
to refill his pipe. He wanted to speak, but there
seemed to be nothing adequate to say. Two men, virile,
thrilling with the ripe, red blood of perfect manhood,
friends, and&ndash;&ndash;a woman stood between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; Jim said, preparing to light his pipe.
&ldquo;The position is&ndash;&ndash;impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now both pipes were smoking as under a forced
draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my life for her,&rdquo; the elder muttered, almost
unconsciously.</p>
<p>Will caught at his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life is hers,&rdquo; he cried, almost defiantly.</p>
<p>They were no further on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you&ndash;&ndash;suggest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will shook his head. The snow on the distant peaks
glistened like diamonds in the gorgeous sunlight, and his
attention seemed riveted upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What pay are you making, Will?&rdquo; Jim inquired
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty dollars a month&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten more than me.&rdquo; Jim laughed harshly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the better match. You&rsquo;re younger, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a wad of her own. A thousand dollars,&rdquo;
added Will.</p>
<p>His remark was unpleasing, and Jim&rsquo;s eyes grew colder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t cut any figure. That&rsquo;s hers,&rdquo; he said
sharply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s useful&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To her&ndash;&ndash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flow of their talk dried up again. They could
make no headway in clearing up their dilemma. To Jim
each passing moment was making things harder; with
each passing moment their friendship was straining under
the pressure. Suddenly a thought flashed through his
brain. It was a light of hope, where, before, all had been
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked her yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;re sailing an uncharted sea, and&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s a
fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a reluctant nod Jim received in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to ask her,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t
marry us both. Maybe she&rsquo;ll marry neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; Jim failed to observe Will&rsquo;s smile of
confidence. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll both ask her. I&rsquo;ve got to go
through Barnriff on my way to the hills. I&rsquo;ll call and
see her. You can ride in this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s an elegant plan&ndash;&ndash;for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quick as a flash Will turned on him. His volcanic
anger rose swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say.&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s response seemed to have
less friendliness in it. Then he knocked his pipe out,
and rose from his seat. &ldquo;No, boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
just play the game right here. We&rsquo;ll take a chance for
who goes to her first. If she wants neither of us&ndash;&ndash;well,
we&rsquo;ll have played the game by each other, anyway. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
if she chooses either of us then the other must take his
medicine like a man. Let&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;be sportsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo; There was no yielding in
Will&rsquo;s sharp question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim leaned forward, holding his empty pipe to point
his words. There was a glow of excited interest in his
eyes as he propounded his idea. With Will it was different.
He sat frigidly listening. If through any generosity
he lost Eve, he would never forgive himself&ndash;&ndash;he
would never forgive Jim. He must have her for his own.
His love for her was a far greater thing, he told himself,
than the colder Jim&rsquo;s could ever be. He could not understand
that Jim, in offering his plan, merely wanted to
be fair, merely wanted to arrange things so that Eve
should not come between them, that neither should be
able to reproach the other for any advantage taken. He
suspected trickery. Nor had he any right to such
base suspicion. Jim&rsquo;s idea was one to make their way
easier. Eve would choose whom she pleased&ndash;&ndash;if either
of them. He could not, did not want to alter that.
Whatever the result of her choice he was ready to accept
it.</p>
<p>He pointed at the revolvers hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall decide who has first speak with her,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll empty six at a mark, and the one who does
the best shooting has&ndash;&ndash;first go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best way. We&rsquo;re a fair match. You&rsquo;re
reckoned the boss shot in the hills, and I don&rsquo;t guess
there&rsquo;s any one on this ranch handier than I am. We&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
both played with those two guns a heap. It&rsquo;ll save bad
blood between us. What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad. Still&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He looked at the guns. He
was thinking swiftly. He knew that he was a wonderful
shot with a revolver. He was in constant practice, too.
Jim was a good shot, but then his practice was very limited.
Yes, the chances were all in his favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get busy then,&rdquo; he said presently, with apparent reluctance.</p>
<p>He rose and moved toward the guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose choice?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Nor did he observe the other&rsquo;s smile as he received
his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Will chose his weapon with studied care, Jim
picked up the soap box and fumbled through his pockets
till he found a piece of chalk. With this he drew a
bull&rsquo;s-eye on the bottom of the box, and sketched two
rough circles around it. Will had made his choice of
weapons by the time the target was completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it do?&rdquo; Jim inquired, holding up the box for
his inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to,&rdquo; was the churlish reply.</p>
<p>Jim gave him a quick glance as he moved across the
room and possessed himself of the remaining pistol.
Then he examined its chambers and silently led the way
out of the hut.</p>
<p>They left the ranch buildings and moved out upon the
prairie. A spot was selected, and the box set down.
Then Jim paced off sixty yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty,&rdquo; he said, as he came to a halt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty,&rdquo; agreed Will, who had paced beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your choice. Will you&ndash;&ndash;get busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will stepped on to the mark confidently, raising his
gun with the surety of a man who does not know what
it means to miss. Yet, before dropping the hammer, he
braced himself with unusual care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plonk!&rdquo; The bullet struck the box. He had found
his mark, and in rapid succession the remaining five chambers
of his gun were emptied. Each shot found its mark
with deadly accuracy, for Will meant to win the contest.</p>
<p>Then they set out to inspect the target. Will led
now. He was eager to ascertain the actual result. An
exclamation of joy broke from him as he snatched up the
box. The bull&rsquo;s-eye was about two inches in diameter;
one of his shots had passed through it, three had broken
its outer line, while the other two were within a quarter
of an inch of the little white patch. All six shots could
have been covered by a three-inch circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Thorpe. And he turned the box round
and drew another target on its side.</p>
<p>The new bull&rsquo;s-eye was a shade smaller. It may have
been accident. It may have been that Jim preferred to
make his own task more difficult than err on the side of
his own advantage. Will said nothing, and they walked
back to the firing point.</p>
<p>Jim lifted his gun and fired. His shots rang out like
the rattle of a maxim gun, so swiftly did he empty the six
chambers. In a few moments they were once more on
their way to inspect the target.</p>
<p>Five bullets had passed through the bull&rsquo;s-eye, the
sixth had broken its line.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see Eve to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Jim
quietly. &ldquo;You can see her later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Will turned away, and moved off
toward the ranch. Jim followed him. Nor was a word
exchanged between them till the hut was reached, and
Will had unhitched his horse from the tying-post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo; inquired Jim, for something to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the younger man&rsquo;s tone, and
his friend looked away while he leaped into the saddle.</p>
<p>Jim seemed to have drawn none of the satisfaction
which the winning of the match should have afforded
him, for he flung the box which he had been carrying
aside as though it had offended him. He wanted to
speak, he wanted to say something pleasant. He wanted
to banish that surly look from Will&rsquo;s eyes; but somehow
he could find nothing to say, nothing to do. He looked
on while the other lifted his reins to ride off. Then, in
desperation, he came up to the horse&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake, Will,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was the effort of a big heart striving to retain a
precious friendship which he felt was slipping away from
him.</p>
<p>But Will did not see the outstretched hand. He
hustled his horse, and, in moving off, his own right foot
struck the waiting man violently. It was almost as
though he had kicked him.</p>
<p>Jim watched him go with regretful eyes. Then, as
the man disappeared among the ranch buildings, he
turned and slowly made his way to the bunk house of the
horse-breakers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>IN BARNRIFF</h3>
</div>
<p>It has been said that the pretentiousness of a newly
carpentered Western American settlement can only be
compared to the &ldquo;side&rdquo; of a nigger wench, weighted
down under the gaudy burden of her Emancipation Day
holiday gown. Although, in many cases, the analogy is
not without aptness, yet, in frequent instances, it would
be a distinct libel. At any rate, Barnriff boasted nothing
of pretentiousness. Certainly Barnriff was not newly
carpentered. Probably it never had been.</p>
<p>It was one of those places that just grow from a tiny
seedling; and, to judge by the anemic result of its effort,
that original seedling could have been little better than a
&ldquo;scratching&rdquo; post on an ill-cared-for farm, or perhaps a
storm shelter. Certainly it could not have risen above an
implement shed in the ranks of structural art. The general
impression was in favor of the &ldquo;scratching&rdquo; post, for
one expects to grow something better than weeds on a
rich loam soil.</p>
<p>The architect of Barnriff&ndash;&ndash;if he ever existed&ndash;&ndash;was probably
a drunkard, not an uncommon complaint in that
settlement, or a person qualified for the state asylum.
The inference is drawn from strong circumstantial evidence,
and not from prejudice. As witness, the saloon
seemed to have claimed his most serious effort as a piece
of finished construction. Here his weakness peeps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
through in no uncertain manner. The bar occupies at
least half of the building, and the fittings of it are large
enough to accommodate sufficient alcohol for an average
man to swim in. His imagination must have been fully
extended in this design, for the result suggested its having
been something in the nature of a labor of affection.
The other half of the building was divided up into three
rooms: a tiny dining-room (obviously the pleasures of the
table had no great appeal for him), a small bedroom for
the proprietor (who seemed to have been considered least
of all), and one vast dormitory, to accommodate those
whose misfortunes of the evening made them physically
incapable of negotiating the intricacies of the village on
their way home.</p>
<p>Of course, this evidence might easily have been
nullified, or even have been turned to the architect&rsquo;s
favor, had the rest of the village borne testimony for
him. A clever counsel defending would probably have
declared that the architect knew the people of the village,
and was merely supplying their wants. Of course he
knew them, and their wants&ndash;&ndash;he was probably one of
them.</p>
<p>However, the rest of the village was all against him.
Had he been an abstemious man, there is no doubt but
the village market-place would have been a square, or a
triangle, an oval, a circle, or&ndash;&ndash;well, some definite shape.
As it was, it had no definite shape. It was not even irregular.
It was nothing&ndash;&ndash;just a space, with no apparent
defining line.</p>
<p>Then there were no definite roads&ndash;&ndash;at least, the roads
seemed to have happened, and ran just where the houses
permitted them. It was a reversal of ordinary civilized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
methods, which possibly had its advantages. There were
certainly no straight lines for the men-folk to walk after
leaving the saloon at night for their homes.</p>
<p>As for the houses which composed the village, they
were too uncertain to be described in any but a general
view of their design, and their grouping. In the latter,
of course, the evidence was all against the designer of the
place. Who but a madman or a drunkard would set up
a laundry next to the coal yard?</p>
<p>Then another thing. Two churches&ndash;&ndash;they called
them &ldquo;churches&rdquo; in Barnriff&ndash;&ndash;of different denomination,
side by side. On Sundays the discord that went on was
painful. The voices of the preachers were in endless conflict
through the thin weather-boarding sides, and when
the rival harmoniums &ldquo;got busy&rdquo; there was nothing left
for the confused congregations but to chant their rival
hymns to some popular national tune upon which they
were mutually agreed beforehand. The incongruities of
this sort were so many that even the most optimistic
could not pass them unheeded.</p>
<p>As regards the style of the buildings themselves, the
less said about them the better. They were buildings,
no one could deny that; but even an impressionist
painter could claim no beauty for them. Windows and
doors, weather-boarding, and shingle roof. One need
say no more, except that they were, in the main, weatherproof.
But wait. There was one little house that had a
verandah and creepers growing around it. It was well
painted, too, and stood out amongst its frowzy neighbors
a thing approaching beauty.</p>
<p>But Barnriff, as a residential hamlet, was hardly worth
considering seriously. It was a topsyturvy sort of place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and its methods were in keeping with its design. It was
full of unique combinations of trade. Some of them
were hardly justifiable. The doctor of the place was also
a horse-dealer, with a side line in the veterinary business.
Any tooth extraction needed was forcibly performed by
John Rust, the blacksmith. The baker, Jake Wilkes,
shod the human foot whenever he was tired of punching
his dough. The Methodist lay-preacher, Abe C. Horsley,
sold everything to cover up the body, whenever he
wasn&rsquo;t concerned with the soul. Then there was Angel
Gay, an estimable butcher and a good enough fellow; but it
hardly seemed right that he should be in combination with
Zac Restless, the carpenter, for the disposal of Barnriff&rsquo;s
corpses. However, these things were, and had been accepted
by the village folk for so long that it seemed almost
a pity to disturb them.</p>
<p>Barnriff, viewed from a distance, was not without a
certain picturesqueness; but the distance had to be great
enough to lose sight of the uncouthness which a close
inspection revealed. Besides, its squalor did not much
matter. It did not affect the temper of the folk living within
its boundaries. To them the place was a little temporary
&ldquo;homelet,&rdquo; to coin a word. For frontier people are, for
the most part, transient. They only pause at such place
on their fighting journey through the wilder life. They
pass on in time to other spheres, some on an upward
grade, others down the long decline, which is the road
of the ne&rsquo;er-do-well. And with each inhabitant that
comes and goes, some detail of evolution is achieved by
the little hamlet through which they pass, until, in the
course of long years, it, too, has fought its way upward
to the mathematical precision and bold glory of a modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
commercial city, or has joined in the downward march
of the ne&rsquo;er-do-well.</p>
<p>The blazing summer sun burned down upon the unsheltered
village. There was no shade anywhere&ndash;&ndash;that
is, outside the houses. For the place had grown up on
the crests of the bald, green rollers of the Western plains
as though its original seedling had been tossed there by
the wanton summer breezes, and for no better reason.</p>
<p>Anthony Smallbones, familiarly known to his intimates
as &ldquo;fussy-breeches,&rdquo; because he lived in a dream-fever
of commercial enterprise, and believed himself to be a
Napoleon of finance&ndash;&ndash;he ran a store, at which he sold a
collection of hardware, books, candy, stationery, notions
and &ldquo;delicatessen&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;was on his way to the boarding-house
for breakfast&ndash;&ndash;there was only one boarding-house
in Barnriff, and all the bachelors had their meals there.</p>
<p>He was never leisurely. He believed himself to be
too busy for leisure. Just now he was concentrated upon
the side issues of a great irrigation scheme that had occupied
his small head for at least twenty-four hours, and
thus it happened that he ran full tilt into Peter Blunt before
he was aware of the giant&rsquo;s presence. He rebounded
and came to, and hurled a savage greeting at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wher&rsquo; you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be your way,&rdquo; the large man vouchsafed,
with quiet good-nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the surly response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of slack, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; inquired Peter, his deep-set
blue eyes twinkling with humor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten two
hours back. This lying a-bed is mighty bad for your
business schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schemes? Gee! I was around at half after five,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
man! Lying a-bed? Say, you don&rsquo;t know what business
means.&rdquo; The little man sniffed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Peter responded. He hunched
his great loose shoulders to shift the position of a small
sack of stuff he was carrying.</p>
<p>He was a man of very large physique and uncertain age.
He possessed a burned up face of great strength, and
good-nature, but it was so weather-stained, so grizzled,
that at first sight it appeared almost harsh. He was an
Englishman who had spent years and years of hardy life
wandering over the remotenesses of the Western plains of
America. Little was known of him, that is to say, little
of that life that must once have been his. He was well
educated, traveled, and possessed an inexhaustible fund
of information on any subject. But beyond the fact that
he had once been a soldier, and that a large slice of his
life had been lived in such places as Barnriff, no one
knew aught of him. And yet it was probable that nobody
on the Western prairies was better known than
Peter Blunt. East and west, north and south, he was
known for a kindly nature, and kindly actions. These
things, and for a devotion to prospecting for gold in
what were generally considered to be the most unlikely
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right? Why o&rsquo; course I&rsquo;m right. Ef you&rsquo;se folk
jest got busy around here, we&rsquo;d make Barnriff hum an
elegant toon. Say, now I got a dandy scheme fer
irrigatin&rsquo; that land back there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. You gave me that yesterday. It&rsquo;s a good
scheme.&rdquo; The giant&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;A great scheme.
You&rsquo;re a wonder. But say, all you told me that day
has set my slow head busy. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a heap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
since on what you said about &lsquo;trusts.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s it, &lsquo;trusts,&rsquo;
&lsquo;trusts&rsquo; and &lsquo;combines.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the way to get on to
millions of dollars. Better than scratching around, eh?
Now here&rsquo;s an idea. I thought I&rsquo;d like to put it to you,
finance and such things being your specialty. There&rsquo;s
Angel Gay. Now he&rsquo;s running a fine partnership with
Restless. Now you take those two as a nucleus. You
yourself open a side-line in drugs, and work in with Doc
Crombie, and pool the result of the four. The Doc
would draw his fees for making folks sick, you&rsquo;d clear a
handsome profit for poisoning them, Gay &rsquo;ud rake in his
dollars for burying &rsquo;em, and Restless?&ndash;&ndash;why Restless &rsquo;ud
put in white pine for oak, and retire on the profits in
five years. Say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got in that sack?&rdquo; inquired Smallbones,
blandly ignoring the other&rsquo;s jest at his expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing that&rsquo;s a heap of interest. I&rsquo;ve been
scratching around at the head waters of the river, back
there in the foot-hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &lsquo;prospects,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed the other, with a malicious
shake of the head. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re allus prospectin&rsquo;
around. I see you diggin&rsquo; Eve Marsham&rsquo;s tater patch
yesterday. Don&rsquo;t guess you made much of a &lsquo;strike&rsquo; in
that layout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Peter shook his head genially. The little
man&rsquo;s drift was obvious. He turned toward the one
attractive cottage in the settlement, and saw a woman&rsquo;s
figure standing at the doorway talking to a diminutive boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess though you&rsquo;ll likely strike more profit diggin&rsquo;
spuds fer folk than you do scratching up loam and loose
rocks the way you do,&rdquo; Smallbones went on sourly.</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;re a far-seeing little man. There&rsquo;s a heap
of gold about Eve&rsquo;s home. A big heap; and I tell you,
if that was my place, I&rsquo;d never need to get outside her
fences to find all I needed. I&rsquo;d be a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones looked up into his face curiously. He
was thinking hard. But his imagination was limited.
Finally he decided that Peter was laughing at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess your humor&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout as elegant as a fun&rsquo;ral.
An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t good on an empty stummick. I pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; cried the giant amiably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn that
&lsquo;trust&rsquo; racket over in my mind. So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode away with great lumbering strides heading
straight for his humble, two-roomed shack. Smallbones,
as he went on to the boarding-house, was full of angry
contempt for the prospector. He was a mean man, and
like most mean men he hated to be laughed at. But
when his anger smoothed down he found himself pitying
any one who spent his life looking for profit, by wasting
a glorious energy, delving for gold in places where
gold was known to be non-existent.</p>
<p>He ruminated on the matter as he went. And wondered.
Then there came to him the memory of vague
stories of gold in the vicinity of the Barnriff. Indian
stories it is true. But then Indian stories often had a
knack of having remarkably truthful foundations. Immediately
his busy brain began to construct a syndicate
of townspeople to hunt up the legends, with a small
capital to carry on operations. He would have the lion&rsquo;s
share in the concern, of course, and&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;they might
make Peter Blunt chief operator. And by the time he
reached the boarding-house all his irrigation scheme was
forgotten in this new toy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>JIM PROPOSES</h3>
</div>
<p>Eve Marsham was in two minds of hailing Peter Blunt
as she saw him pass on his way to his hut. She wanted
him. She wanted to ask his advice about something.
Like many others who needed a sympathetic adviser she
preferred to appeal to Peter Blunt rather than to any of
her sex in Barnriff. However, she allowed the opportunity
to slip by, and saw him disappear within his doorway.
Then she turned again to the boy sitting on the
rough bench beside her, and a look of alarm leaped to
her soft brown eyes. He was holding out a tiny pup at
arm&rsquo;s length, grasping it by one of its little fore paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elia, how can you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Put him down,
instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy turned a bland, beautiful face to her. There
was seemingly no expression beyond surprise in his pale
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes it,&rdquo; he said, while the whimpering pup still
wriggled in his grasp.</p>
<p>Eve made a move to take the wretched animal away,
but the boy promptly hugged it to his misshapen breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can do what I like with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no anger in his voice, not even protest. It
was a simple statement of denial that at the same time
had no resistance in it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you be cruel,&rdquo; Eve exclaimed shortly,
and her eyes turned once more in the direction of Peter
Blunt&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>Her pretty face was very thoughtful. Her sun-tanned
cheeks, her tall, rounded body were the picture of health.
She looked as fresh and wholesome as any wild prairie
flower with her rich coloring of almost tropical splendor.
She was neatly dressed, more after town fashion than in
the method of such places as Barnriff, and her expressed
reason for thus differentiating from her fellow villagers
was a matter of mild advertisement. She made her living
as a dressmaker. She was Barnriff&rsquo;s leading and
only <i>modiste</i>.</p>
<p>The boy at her side continued his amusement at the
puppy&rsquo;s expense. He held it in his two hands and
squeezed its little body until the poor creature gasped
and retched. Then he swung it to and fro by its diminutive
tail. Then he threw it up in the air, making it turn
a somersault, and catching it again clumsily.</p>
<p>All this he did in a mild, emotionless manner. There
was no boyish interest or amusement in it. Just a calm,
serious immobility that gave one the impression of a
painting by one of the old European masters.</p>
<p>Elia was Eve Marsham&rsquo;s crippled brother. He was
seven years younger than she, and was just about to turn
sixteen. In reality he was more than a cripple. He was
a general deformity, a deformity that somehow even
reached his brain. By this it must not be imagined that
he was an idiot, or lacking in intelligence in any way,
but he had some curious mental twists that marked him
as something out of the normal. His chief peculiarity
lay in his dread of pain to himself. An ache, a trifling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
bruise, a mere scratch upon himself, would hurl him into
a paroxysm of terror which frequently terminated in a
fit, or, at least, convulsions of a serious nature. This
drove the girl, who was his only living relative, to great
pains in her care of him, which, combined with an almost
maternal love for him, kept her on a rack of apprehension
for his well-being.</p>
<p>He had another strange side to his character, and one
of which everybody but Eve was aware. He possessed a
morbid love for horror, for the sufferings of others. He
had been known to sit for hours with a sick man in the
village who was suffering agonies of rheumatism, for the
mere delight of drawing from him details of the pains he
was enduring, and reveling in the horror of the description
with ghoulish delight.</p>
<p>When Restless, the carpenter, broke his leg the boy
was always around. And when the wretched man
groaned while they set it, his face was a picture of rapt
fascination. To Eve his visits on such occasions were a
sign of his sympathetic nature, and she encouraged him
because she did not know the real meaning of them.
But there were other things she did not know. He used
to pay weekly visits to Gay&rsquo;s slaughter yard on killing
day, and reveled in the cruel task of skinning and cutting
up the carcase of the slaughtered beast. If a fight between
two men occurred in the village Elia&rsquo;s instinct led
him unerringly to it. It was a curious psychological
fact that the pains and sufferings which, for himself, he
dreaded with an almost insane abhorrence, he loved and
desired in others.</p>
<p>He was a quaint figure, a figure to draw sympathy and
pity from the hardiest. He was precisely four feet high.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
One leg was shorter than the other, and the hip was
drawn up in a corresponding manner. His chest was
sunken, and his back was hunched, and he carried his
head bent sideways on his shoulders, in the inquiring
attitude one associates with a bird.</p>
<p>He was his sister&rsquo;s sole charge, left to her, when much
younger, by their dying mother. And the girl lavished
on him all the wealth of a good woman&rsquo;s sympathy and
love. She saw nothing of his faults. She saw only his
deplorable physical condition, and his perfect angel-face.
His skin and complexion were so transparent that one
could almost have counted the veins beneath the surface;
the sun had no power to burn that face to the russet
which was the general complexion among prairie folk.
His mouth had the innocence of a babe&rsquo;s, and formed a
perfect Cupid&rsquo;s bow, such as a girl might well be proud of.
His eyes were large, inquiring and full of intelligence.
His nose might have been chiseled by an old Greek
sculptor, while his hair, long and wavy, was of the texture
and color of raw silk.</p>
<p>He was certainly the idol of Eve&rsquo;s heart. In him she
could see no wrong, no vice. She cherished him, and
served him, and worked for him. He was her life. And,
as is only natural, he had learned to claim as his right all
that which out of her boundless affection it was her joy
to bestow.</p>
<p>Suddenly the yelping of the pup brought Eve round
on him again. He was once more holding it aloft by its
tail. The girl darted to its rescue, and, instantly, Elia
released his hold, and the poor creature fell with a squelching
sound upon the ground. She gave a little scream,
but the boy only looked on in silent fascination. Fortunately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the poor pup was only badly shaken and hastily
crawled away to safety. Elia was for recovering it, but
Eve promptly vetoed his design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, you cruel boy,&rdquo; she said sharply.
&ldquo;You remain where you are. You can tell me about the
chicken killing down at Restless&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the interest of the subject on which Eve desired
information Elia forgot all about the pup. He offered no
protest nor made the least demur, but forthwith began his
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will,&rdquo; he said, with a curious, uncanny laugh.
&ldquo;Old Ma Restless is just raving her fat head off. I was
around this morning and heard her. Gee! She was
sayin&rsquo; things. She was cussin&rsquo; and cussin&rsquo; like mad. So
I jest turned in the yard to see. It was just as funny as
a circus. She stood there, her fat sides all of a wabble,
an&rsquo; a reg&rsquo;lar waterfall pourin&rsquo; out of her eyes. He! He!
But what made me laff most was to see those checkens
around her on the ground. There was ten of &rsquo;em lying
around, and somebody had choppened off all their heads.
Say, the blood was tricklin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;well, there, you never
did see such a mess. It was real comic, an&rsquo; I&ndash;&ndash;well, to
see her wringin&rsquo; her fat hands, and cussin&rsquo;. Gee! I
wonder she wasn&rsquo;t struck for it, an&rsquo; her a woman an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed silently, while his sister stared at him in
amazement.</p>
<p>Finally she checked his amusement sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then she see me, an&rsquo; she turned on me like a
wildcat, an&rsquo; I was &rsquo;most scairt to death. She said, &lsquo;What
you doin&rsquo; here, you imp o&rsquo; Satan? Who&rsquo;s done this? Tell
me! Tell me an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll lay for &rsquo;em! I&rsquo;ll shoot &rsquo;em down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
like vermin.&rsquo; I knew she wasn&rsquo;t really talkin&rsquo; to me, so
then I wasn&rsquo;t scairt. She was jest blowin&rsquo; off steam.
Then I got around an&rsquo; looked close at &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;the checkens,
I mean&ndash;&ndash;and I see just where the knife had cut their
necks off. It was an elegant way of killing &rsquo;em, and say,
how they must have flapped around after they&rsquo;d got clear
of their silly heads.&rdquo; He laughed gleefully again. &ldquo;I
looked up after that and see her watchin&rsquo; me. Guess her
eyes was kind of funny lookin&rsquo;, so I said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
need to take on, mam,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll make elegant
roasts, an&rsquo; you can get busy and hatch out some more.&rsquo;
And somehow she got quiet then, and I watched her
gather them checkens up, an&rsquo; take &rsquo;em into the house.
Then when she came out an&rsquo; see me again, she says,
&lsquo;Light you right out o&rsquo; here, you imp o&rsquo; Satan! I fair
hates the sight o&rsquo; you.&rsquo; So I lit out. Say, Eve,&rdquo; he
added, after a reflective pause, &ldquo;why does folks all hate
me so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sighed and shook her head. Then she came
over to him, and, bending down, kissed his fair waving
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear. I don&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps it is you offend folks somehow. You know
you do manage to upset folks at times. You seem to
say&ndash;&ndash;say queer things to them, and get them mad.&rdquo; She
smiled down upon the boy a little wistfully. She knew
her brother was disliked by most in the village, and it
pained her terribly that it should be so. They tried to
be outwardly kind to him, but she always felt that it was
solely for her sake and never for his. As Elia had never
spoken of it before, she had lived in the hope that he did
not understand their dislike. However, it was as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
that he should know. If he realized it now, as he grew
older he might endeavor to earn their good-will in spite
of present prejudice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it must be, sis. You see I don&rsquo;t kind of mean
to say things,&rdquo; he said almost regretfully. &ldquo;Only when
they&rsquo;re in my head they must come out, or&ndash;&ndash;or I think
my head would jest bust,&rdquo; he finished up naively.</p>
<p>The girl was still smiling, and one arm stole round the
boy&rsquo;s hunched shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t help saying those things you
know to be true&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they most generally ain&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innocent, inquiring eyes looked straight up into
hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he went on positively, &ldquo;they generally ain&rsquo;t. I
don&rsquo;t think my head would bust keepin&rsquo; in the truth.
Now, yesterday, Will Henderson was down at the saloon
before he came up to see you. He came and sort of
spoke nice to me. I know he hates me, and&ndash;&ndash;and I hate
him worse&rsquo;n poison. Well, he spoke nice to me, as I
said, an&rsquo; I wanted to spit at him for it. And I jest set
to and tho&rsquo;t and tho&rsquo;t how I could hurt him. And so I
said, right out before all the boys, &lsquo;Wot for do you allus
come hangin&rsquo; around our shack? Eve&rsquo;s most sick to
death with you,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t as if she ast you to get
around, it&rsquo;s just you buttin&rsquo; in. If you was Jim Thorpe
now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never said all that, Elia,&rdquo; cried Eve, sternly. All
her woman&rsquo;s pride was outraged, and she felt her fingers
itching to box the boy&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did sure,&rdquo; Elia went on, in that sober tone of decided
self-satisfaction. &ldquo;And I said a heap more. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
didn&rsquo;t the boys jest laff. Will went red as a beet, and
the boys laffed more. And I was real glad. I hate
Will! Say, he was up here last night. Wot for? He
was up here from six to nigh nine. Say, sis, I wish you
wouldn&rsquo;t have him around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve did not respond. She was staring out at the
rampart of hills beyond, where Will worked. She was
thinking of Will, thinking of&ndash;&ndash;but the boy was insistent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;d have been real glad if it had been Jim
Thorpe. Only he don&rsquo;t come so often, does he? I like
him. Say, Jim&rsquo;s allus good to me. I don&rsquo;t never seem
to want to hurt him. No, sure. Jim&rsquo;s good. But
Will&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Say, sis, Will&rsquo;s a bad lot; he is certain. I
know. He&rsquo;s never done nuthing bad, I know, but I can
see it in his face, his eyes. It&rsquo;s in his head, too. Do
you know I can allus tell when bad&rsquo;s in folks&rsquo; heads.
Now, there&rsquo;s Smallbones. He&rsquo;s a devil. You&rsquo;ll see it,
too, some day. Then there&rsquo;s Peter Blunt. Now Peter&rsquo;s
that good he&rsquo;d break his neck if he thought it &rsquo;ud help
folks. But Will&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elia,&rdquo; Eve was bending over the boy&rsquo;s crooked form.
Her cheek was resting on his silky hair. She could not
face those bland inquiring eyes. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say anything
against Will. I like him. He&rsquo;s not a bad man&ndash;&ndash;really
he isn&rsquo;t, and you mustn&rsquo;t say he is. Will is just a
dear, foolish Irish boy, and when once he has settled
down will be&ndash;&ndash;you wait&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy abruptly wriggled out of his sister&rsquo;s embrace.
His eyes sought hers so that she could no longer avoid
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wait for anything to do with Will Henderson&ndash;&ndash;if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
that&rsquo;s what you mean. I tell you he&rsquo;s no good. I
hate him! I hate him! And&ndash;&ndash;and I hope some one&rsquo;ll
kill all the checkens he&rsquo;s left in your care down at that
old shack of his.&rdquo; He scrambled to his feet and hobbled
away, vanishing round the corner of the house in a fury
of fierce resentment.</p>
<p>He had been roused to one of his dreaded fits of passion,
and Eve was alarmed. In a fever of apprehension
she was about to follow him up and soothe him, when she
saw a horseman galloping toward the house. The figure
was unmistakable, besides she knew the horse&rsquo;s gait and
color. It was Jim Thorpe, riding in from the AZ ranch.</p>
<p>In a few moments he drew rein at the gate of her
vegetable patch. He flung the reins over his horse&rsquo;s
head and removed the bit from its mouth. Then he let
it wander grazing on the tawny grass of the market-place.</p>
<p>Eve waited for him to come up the garden path, and
for the moment the boy was forgotten. She welcomed
him with the cordiality of old friendship. There was
genuine pleasure in her smile, there was hearty welcome
in her eyes, and in the soft, warm grip of her strong
young hand, but that was all. There was no shyness, no
avoiding the honest devotion in his look. The radiant
hope shining in his clear, dark eyes was not for her understanding.
The unusual care in his dress, the neatly
polished boots under his leather chaps, the creamy whiteness
of his cotton shirt, the store creases of the new silk
handkerchief about his neck, none of these things struck
her as being anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>And he, blind soul, took courage from the warmth of
her welcome. His heart beat high with a hope which no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
ordinary mundane affairs could have inspired. All the
ill-fate behind him was wiped off the slate. The world
shone radiant before eyes, which, at such times, are mercifully
blinded to realities. An Almighty Providence
sees that every man shall live to the full such moments
as were his just then. It is in the great balance of
things. The greater the joy, the harder&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But what
matters the other side of the picture!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I was hoping to find you&ndash;&ndash;not
busy. I&rsquo;ve ridden right in to yarn with you&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;bout
things. Say, maybe you&rsquo;ve got five minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always got five minutes for you, Jim,&rdquo; the girl
responded warmly. &ldquo;Sit right down here on this seat,
and get&ndash;&ndash;going. How&rsquo;s things with the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully! Dan McLagan&rsquo;s getting big notions of doing
things; he&rsquo;s heaping up the dollars in plenty. And I&rsquo;m
glad, because with him doing well I&rsquo;m doing well. I&rsquo;ve
already got an elegant bunch of cows and calves up in the
foot-hills. You see I make trade with him for my wages.
I&rsquo;ve done more. Yesterday I got him to promise me a
lease of grazing, and a big patch for a homestead way up
there in the foot-hills. In another two years I mean to
be ranching on my own, eh? How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes were bright with responsive enthusiasm.
She was smiling with delight at this dear friend&rsquo;s evident
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great, Jim. But how quiet you&rsquo;ve been over it.
You never even hinted before&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head, and for a moment a shadow
of regret passed across his handsome face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I waited until I was sure of that lease.
I&rsquo;ve come so many falls I didn&rsquo;t guess I wanted to try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
another by anticipating too much. So I just waited.
It&rsquo;s straight going now,&rdquo; he went on, with a return to his
enthusiasm, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to start building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. You&rsquo;ll get everything ready for leaving
the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo; in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years, yes. I&rsquo;ll put up a three-roomed shack of
split logs, a small barn, and branding corrals. That&rsquo;ll be
the first start. You see&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he paused&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know
about that shack. Now what about the size of the rooms
and things? I&ndash;&ndash;I thought I&rsquo;d ask you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned inquiring eyes upon him. She was
searching his face for something, and that something
came to her as an unwelcome discovery, for she abruptly
turned away again, and her attention was held by those
distant hills, where Will Henderson worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said seriously. The light of enthusiasm
had died out of her eyes, leaving them somehow
sad and regretful. &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know a man&rsquo;s requirements
in such things. A woman has ideas, but
that is chiefly for herself. You see, she has the care of
the house generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Jim broke in eagerly. Then he
checked himself. Something in Eve&rsquo;s manner gave him
pause. &ldquo;You see I&ndash;&ndash;I wanted a woman&rsquo;s ideas. I don&rsquo;t
want the house for a man. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish what he had to say. Somehow
words failed him. It was not that he found it difficult to
put what he wanted to say into words. Something in
the girl&rsquo;s manner checked his eagerness and drove him to
silence. He, too, suddenly found himself staring out at
the hills, where&ndash;&ndash;Will worked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>For one fleeting instant Eve turned her gentle eyes
upon the face beside her. She saw the strong features,
the steady look of the dark eyes, the clean-cut profile
and determined jaw. She saw, too, that he was thinking
hard, and her woman&rsquo;s instinct came to her aid. She felt
that she must be the first to speak. And on what she
said depended what would follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave the house until toward the end of the
two years? By that time you will have been able to talk
it over with&ndash;&ndash;the right person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eagerness leaped again. He thought he saw an
opening. His eyes had in them the question he wanted
to ask. All his soul was behind his words, all his great
depth of feeling and love looked out at the rounded oval
of her sweet face. He hungrily took in the beauty of her
hair, her eyes, her cheeks; the sweet richness of her ripe
lips, the chiseled roundness of her beautiful neck. He
longed to crush her to his heart where they sat. He
longed to tell her that she and she only of all women
could ever occupy the hut he intended to build; he
longed to pour into her ears his version of the old, old
story, and so full was his great, strong heart, so overwhelming
was his lover&rsquo;s madness, that he believed he
could tell that story as it had never been told before.
But the question never reached his lips. The old story
was not for his telling. Nor did he ask himself why. It
was as though a power which was all-mastering forbade
him to speak further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Will to-day?&rdquo; Eve suddenly inquired,
with apparent irrelevance. &ldquo;I half expected
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; And she broke off purposely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>The look in Jim&rsquo;s eyes hardened to one of acute apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were&ndash;&ndash;expecting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, Jim.&rdquo; She withdrew her gaze
from the distant hills, and, gently smiling, turned her
eyes upon him. They were full of sympathy and profound
kindness. &ldquo;You see, he came here last night.
And, well, I thought he said something about&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started. A shiver passed through his body. He
suddenly felt cold in that blazing sun. His eyes painfully
sought the girl&rsquo;s face. His look was an appeal, an
appeal for a denial of what in his heart he feared. For
some seconds he did not speak. There was no sound between
them, but of his breathing, which had become suddenly
heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&ndash;&ndash;Will was here last night?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>His voice was husky and unusual. But he dropped
his eyes before the innocent look of inquiry in the
girl&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; he spent the evening with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In lowering his eyes Jim found them staring at the
girl&rsquo;s hands, resting in her lap. On one of them he
noticed, for the first time, a gold band. It was the inside
of a ring. It was on the third finger of the left hand.
He had never seen Eve wearing rings before. Suddenly
he reached out and caught her hands in his. He turned
them over with almost brutal roughness. Eve tried to
withdraw them, but he held them fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ring!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hoarsely. It was in full
view now. &ldquo;It is Will&rsquo;s. It was my father&rsquo;s signet ring.
I gave it to him. Where?&ndash;&ndash;How&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;? But no, you
needn&rsquo;t tell me, I guess.&rdquo; He almost flung her hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
from him. And a wave of sickness swept over him as
he thought.</p>
<p>Then in a moment all the passion of his heart rose
uppermost in him, and its scorching tide swept through
his body, maddening him, driving him. A torrent of
words surged to his lips, words of bitterness, cruel words
that would hurt the girl, hurt himself, words of hateful
intensity, words that might ease his tortured soul at the
expense of those who had always occupied foremost place
in his heart.</p>
<p>But they were not uttered. He choked them back with
a gasp, and seized himself in an iron grip of will. And,
for some moments, he held on as a drowning man may
cling to the saving hand. He must not hurt the girl, he
must not wound her love by betraying his cousin. If
Will had not played the game, at any rate he would.
Suddenly, he spoke again, and no one would have
suspected the storm raging under his calm exterior.
Only his voice was hoarse, and his lips were dry, and the
usually clear whites of his eyes were bloodshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy has asked you, then?&rdquo; he said slowly.
And he waited for the death-knell of all his hopes, his
love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Eve&rsquo;s voice was very low. Her gentle woman&rsquo;s
heart ached, for her instinct told her of the pain she was
causing. &ldquo;Last night he asked me to be his wife, and I&ndash;&ndash;I
love him, Jim, and so I consented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; There was weariness in the man&rsquo;s voice
now. It sounded almost as though he were physically
weary. &ldquo;I hope you will be happy, dear. Will&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;a
good boy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I asked him if you knew anything about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
And he said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; He said it would be a little surprise for
you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; You are not going?&rdquo; Jim had suddenly
started to his feet. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you wait for Will? He&rsquo;s
staying in the village. He said he&rsquo;d be up to see me this
morning&ndash;&ndash;before he went out to the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim could stand no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me, Eve,&rdquo; he said, almost harshly.
&ldquo;Will&rsquo;s not good at surprises. No, I won&rsquo;t stay. I&rsquo;ll get
right back, after I&rsquo;ve done some business in the village.&rdquo;
He stood, glancing thoughtfully down at the village for
some moments. Then he turned again, and a shadowy
smile lit his sombre eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given out a contract for that homestead,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to cancel it. Good-bye, little
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be sorry. Get all the happiness you can.
Maybe Will will be a real good husband to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved away and strode after his horse. The beast
was well out on the market-place, and Eve watched him
catch it and clamber into the saddle. Then she turned
away with a sigh, and found herself looking into the
beautiful face of her brother. He had silently crept up to
her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt him, sis; you&rsquo;ve hurt him real bad. Did
you see? It was all inside. Inside here;&rdquo; the boy
folded his delicate hands over his hollow breast. &ldquo;I
know it because I feel it here, too. It&rsquo;s as though you&rsquo;d
taken right hold of a bunch of cords here, and were pulling
&rsquo;em, tearing &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; someway they&rsquo;re fixed right on
to your heart. That&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;ve hurt him, an&rsquo; it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
hurts me, because I like him&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s good. You don&rsquo;t
know what it feels when a man&rsquo;s hurt. I do. It&rsquo;s elegant
pain. Gee!&rdquo; His calm face was quite unlit by the
emotion he described. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t stop at your heart. It
gets right through to your muscles, and they tingle and
itch to do something, and they mostly want to hurt, same
as you&rsquo;ve been hurt. Then it gets to the head, through
the blood. That&rsquo;s it; the blood gets hot, and it makes
the brain hot, an&rsquo; when the brain&rsquo;s hot it thinks hot
thoughts, an&rsquo; they scorch an&rsquo; make you feel violent.
You think hurt for some one, see? It&rsquo;s all over the
body alike. It&rsquo;s when men get hurt like that that they
want to kill. Gee! You&rsquo;ve hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy paused a little breathlessly. His tense nerves
were quivering with some sort of mental strain. It was
as though he were watching something that was going
on inside himself, and the effort was tremendous, physically
and mentally. But, used as Eve was to his vagaries,
she saw none of this. She was thinking only of Jim.
Thinking of the suffering which her brother had said she
had caused him. Woman-like, she felt she must excuse
herself. Yet she knew she had nothing to blame herself
with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only told him I had promised to marry Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy uttered a little cry. It was a strange sound,
unlike anything human. He rushed at her, and his thin
hands seized upon her wrists, and clutched them violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to marry Will? You! You! And
you&rsquo;ve hurt him&ndash;&ndash;to marry Will?&rdquo; Then, with the
force of his clutch upon her wrists, he drew her down
toward him till her face was near to his, and his placid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
eyes looked coldly into hers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;hurt&ndash;&ndash;me&ndash;&ndash;too,&rdquo;
he hissed into her face, &ldquo;and I almost&ndash;&ndash;hate you.
No, it&rsquo;s not you&ndash;&ndash;but I hate Will worse&rsquo;n I ever hated
anything in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TO THE RED, DANCING DEVIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Jim Thorpe dashed the vicious rowels of his Mexican
spurs into the flanks of his horse. Such unaccustomed
treatment sent the willing beast racing headlong across
the market-place, while the guiding hand mechanically
directed toward the saloon.</p>
<p>A storm of bitterness wrung the man&rsquo;s heart. A
murky pall of depression hung over his brain, deadening
his sense of proportion for all those things that matter.
For the time, at least, it crushed down in his heart that
spirit of striving, which was one of his best characteristics,
and utterly quenched the warm fires of his better
nature. All thought was buried in a fog of wrath, which
left him a prey to instincts utterly foreign to his normal
condition. He had left Eve Marsham&rsquo;s presence in a
furious state from which no effort seemed able to
clear him. Nothing gripped his understanding&ndash;&ndash;nothing
save the knowledge of what he had lost, and the conviction
of the low-down trick that had been played upon
him by one whom he regarded as a dear, younger
brother.</p>
<p>He drew rein at the saloon and flung out of the saddle.
He mechanically hitched his horse to the tie-post. Then,
with unconscious aggressiveness, he strode up to the
building and pushed his way through the swing doors.</p>
<p>The bar was empty, an unusual enough circumstance
at that time of the day to draw comment from any one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
who knew the habits of the men of Barnriff; but Thorpe
did not notice it. His eyes were on the man behind the
counter standing ready to serve him. He strode over to
him and flung down a ten-dollar bill, ordering a drink of
whiskey, and a bottle of the spirit to take away with
him. He was promptly served, and Silas Rocket, the
proprietor, civilly passed the time of day. It elicited no
responsive greeting, for Jim gulped down his drink, and
helped himself to another. The second glass of the fiery
spirit he swallowed greedily, while Rocket looked on in
amazement. As he proceeded to pour out another the
man&rsquo;s astonishment found vent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A third?&rdquo; he said stupidly.</p>
<p>Jim deigned no answer, but drank the liquor down,
and set the glass forcefully upon the counter.</p>
<p>The saloon-keeper quickly recovered himself. Nor was
he slow to comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feelin&rsquo; mean, some?&rdquo; he observed, with a sympathetic
wink. He cared little how his visitor took his remark.
He was used to the vagaries of his customers,
and cared not a snap of the fingers for them.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s reply came swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mean enough to need your hogwash,&rdquo; he said
shortly.</p>
<p>Silas Rocket&rsquo;s eyes snapped. He was never a man to
take things sitting down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hogwash it is when a feller o&rsquo; your manners swills
it. Mebbe it&rsquo;ll clear some o&rsquo; the filth off&rsquo;n your measly
chest. Have one on me; I&rsquo;d be real glad to help in the
cleanin&rsquo; process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a subtle threat underlying his last words.
But Jim cared nothing for what he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for all I need,&rdquo; he retorted, turning from the
counter, and bearing his bottle away over to the window.</p>
<p>Rocket shrugged and turned to his work of setting
some sort of order among his bottles. But, as Jim stood
at the window with his back turned, his narrow eyes
frequently regarded him and his busy brain speculated as
to his humor. The ranchman was well liked in Barnriff,
but his present attitude puzzled the worthy host.</p>
<p>However, the object of all this attention was wholly
unaware of it. Even if it had been otherwise, it is doubtful
if Thorpe would have cared in the least. He was lost
in a rushing train of thought. His brain had cleared
under the stimulating potions of raw whiskey, and, just
as before his chaotic state had made him unable to grasp
things fully, now it was equally chaotic in an opposite
direction. His brain was running riot with a clearness
and rapidity that showed only too plainly the nervous
tension under which he was laboring. He was piecing
this latest trick of fortune with the ill-luck which seemed
to be ever pursuing him. Under the influence of the
burning spirit he seemed to have lost the sting of the
actual wrong to himself, and in its place a morbid train
of thought had been set working.</p>
<p>It was a persecution that was steadily dogging him.
When his early misfortunes had come he had accepted
them stoically, believing them to be part of the balance
of things, beginning on the wrong side, no doubt, but
which would be leveled up later on. Time and again he
had received these buffets, and he had merely smiled, a
little grimly perhaps, and started to &ldquo;buck the game&rdquo;
afresh.</p>
<p>Then, when things eventually turned slightly in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
favor, very slightly, out here on the prairie amongst the
derelicts, the flotsam of the grassy ocean, he had found a
brief breathing space. He had begun to think the balance
had really turned. Hope dawned, and life offered fresh
possibilities. And now&ndash;&ndash;now he had been let down
afresh. Before, the attack had been directed against the
worldly hopes of a man, such as all see crushed at some
time in life, but now it was his spirit that was aimed at.
It was that strong, living soul which was the mainspring
of his moral existence.</p>
<p>He had lost the woman he loved; that was something
he could face, something he could live down. But it was
the manner of it. It was the fact of Will&rsquo;s treachery
that had opened the vital wound.</p>
<p>The thought chilled his heart, it crushed him. Yet his
anger was not all for the man who had so rankly betrayed
his trust, his bitterness was not all for the fact
itself. It was the evidence it afforded of the merciless
hand of an invisible foe at work against him, and with
which he was powerless to contend. The subtlety of it&ndash;&ndash;to
his exaggerated thought&ndash;&ndash;was stupendous.</p>
<p>Slowly his bitterness resolved itself to an unutterable
pessimism; the acuteness of the stimulant was wearing
off. There was an unhealthy streak in his mind somewhere,
a streak that was growing under these blows
which had been so liberally dealt him. Where was the
use in struggling? he began to ask himself. And the
poison of the thought acted like a sedative. He grew
strangely calm; he almost experienced pleasure and
comfort under its influence. Why struggle? Nothing
could go right with him. Nothing. He was cursed&ndash;&ndash;cursed
with an ill-starred fortune. This sort of thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
was his fate. Fate. That was it. Why struggle
against it?</p>
<p>He had but this one short life to live. He would live
it. He would live it in the way he chose, without regard
to the ethics of civilization. What mattered if he shortened
it by years, or if he lived to what might be looked
upon as an honored old age? And what was there afterward?
He even began to doubt if there was anything
before&ndash;&ndash;if there was any just&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; He paused and
shivered as the thought came to him. And he was glad
he paused. To question the Deity was to rank himself
at once with a sect he had always despised as self-centred
fools, and pitied them as purblind creatures who
were in some degree mentally deficient.</p>
<p>He pulled himself together and returned to the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me another whiskey,&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>But Silas Rocket had not forgotten; he rarely ever did
forget things in the nature of rudeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;but I guess I&rsquo;ll sell
you &rsquo;most anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim accepted the snub silently, drank his whiskey, paid
for it, and went out.</p>
<p>Rocket looked after him. His eyes were unfriendly,
but then they were generally unfriendly. As the doors
swung to behind his customer he turned and looked in
through the doorway behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s been in. He&rsquo;s had
four drinks o&rsquo; whiskey, and took a bottle with him. He&rsquo;s
been thinkin&rsquo; a whole heap, too. Guess he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on a
sky-high drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a shrewish voice called back to him in a tone of
feminine spleen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s that Marsham gal,&rdquo; it said conclusively.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s instinct is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jim was riding across the market-place.
Half-way across he saw Smallbones. He hailed him,
and the little man promptly hurried up to his horse&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>Jim knew that Smallbones disliked him. But just now
he was only seeking ordinary information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I find Restless?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
he working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I see him over by Peter Blunt&rsquo;s shack. Him
an&rsquo; Peter wus gassin&rsquo; together, while you wus up ther&rsquo;
seein&rsquo; Eve Marsham,&rdquo; Smallbones replied meaningly.
&ldquo;I &rsquo;lows Peter&rsquo;s mostly nosin&rsquo; around when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll ride over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim made as though to ride off. He understood the
spiteful nature of this little busybody, and was in no
mood to listen to him now. But Smallbones was something
of a leech when he chose. He had seen the
whiskey bottle sticking out of Jim&rsquo;s coat pocket, and his
Barnriff thirst and curiosity were agog, for Jim was at no
time a man to waste money in drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, givin&rsquo; a party?&rdquo; he sneered, pointing at the
bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a party to a dead friend,&rdquo; replied Jim, with a
wintry smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s inexpensive, less trouble, and there&rsquo;s
more for myself. So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minute or two later Smallbones was serving Angel
Gay in his store. He had just sold him a butcher&rsquo;s knife
of inferior quality at double New York prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he observed, in the intimate manner of fellow
villagers. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dead? I ain&rsquo;t heard nuthin&rsquo;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Mebbe you&rsquo;ll know, your bizness kind o&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; in
that line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t heerd tell,&rdquo; the butcher replied, with a solemn
shake of his large head. &ldquo;An&rsquo; most o&rsquo; them come my
way, too,&rdquo; he added, with thoughtful pride. &ldquo;Here,
wait.&rdquo; He drew out a greasy note-book. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;see I kind
o&rsquo; keep re-cords o&rsquo; likely folks. Mebbe some o&rsquo; the
names&rsquo;ll prompt you. Now ther&rsquo;s M. Wilkes, she&rsquo;s got
a swellin&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t rightly know wher&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;ther&rsquo;s folk talks
of it bein&rsquo; toomer&ndash;&ndash;deadly toomer. You ain&rsquo;t heerd if
she&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; he inquired hopefully, while he thumbed
the pages of his book over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. I ain&rsquo;t heerd,&rdquo; said Smallbones. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t guess it&rsquo;s a woman. Friend o&rsquo; Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured the happy butcher, lifting his eyes
to the ceiling for inspiration. &ldquo;That kind o&rsquo; simplifies
things. Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he pondered. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got a
heap o&rsquo; friends, as you might say. Ther&rsquo;s Will Henderson,&rdquo;
he turned over the pages of his book. &ldquo;Um,
healthy, drinks a bit. Hasty temper, but good for fifty
year &rsquo;less he gits into a shootin&rsquo; racket. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t him
now?&rdquo; he inquired looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t him. I see him this mornin&rsquo;. He was
soused some. Kind o&rsquo; had a heavy night. Wot about
McLagan of the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the butcher turned over the pages of his note-book.
But finished by shaking his head mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;McLagan&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout forty, never
sick. Only chance &lsquo;accident on ranch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked blankly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot set you thinkin&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired the butcher at
last.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Jest nuthin&rsquo; o&rsquo; consequence. Thorpe sed as he was
givin&rsquo; a party to a dead friend. He&rsquo;d got a bottle o&rsquo;
whiskey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Gay, with an air of relief, returning
his note-book to his pocket. &ldquo;That clears
things. He&rsquo;s speakin&rsquo; metaphoric. I&rsquo;ll git goin&rsquo;, kind o&rsquo;
busy. I ain&rsquo;t sent out the day&rsquo;s meat yet, an&rsquo; I got to
design a grave fixin&rsquo; fer Restless&rsquo;s last kid. Y&rsquo;see it&rsquo;s a
gratis job, I guess, Restless bein&rsquo; my pardner, as you
might say. So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim reached Peter Blunt&rsquo;s hut as the carpenter was
leaving it. Peter was at the door, and smiled a genial
welcome. He and Jim were excellent friends. They
were both men who thought. They both possessed a
wide knowledge of things which were beyond the focus
of the Barnriff people, and consequently they interested
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Jim,&rdquo; the giant called to him, as he drew up
beside the carpenter.</p>
<p>Jim returned his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come along, Peter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess I need a
word with Restless first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned to the man at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need those buildings,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ordered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you anything I owe you. You can let me
know how much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed on to the hut without waiting for a reply.
He had no intention of arguing anything concerning his
future plans with Restless. If the carpenter stood to lose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
he would see him right&ndash;&ndash;well, there was nothing more
about it that concerned him.</p>
<p>Peter was inside his hut examining a litter of auriferous
soil on his table when Jim entered. This man&rsquo;s home
possessed an unique interior. It was such as one would
hardly have expected in a bachelor in Barnriff. There
were none of the usual impedimenta of a prairie man&rsquo;s
abode, there was no untidiness, no dirt, no makeshift.
Yet like the man himself the place was simple and unpretentious.</p>
<p>There were other signs of the man in it, too. There
was a large plain wooden bookcase filled to overflowing
with a choice collection of reading matter. There were
rows of classics in several languages, there was modern
fiction of the better kind, there were many volumes of
classical verse. In short it was the collection of a student,
and might well have been a worthy addition to
many a more elaborate library.</p>
<p>There were, besides this, several excellent pictures in
water-color on the walls, and the absence of all tawdry
decoration was conspicuous. Even the bed, the chair,
and the table, plain enough, goodness knows, had an air
of belonging to a man of unusual personality.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe adequately the manner
in which the character of Peter Blunt peeped out at
one from every corner of his home, nevertheless it did
impress itself upon his every visitor. And its peculiar
quality affected all alike. There was a strangely gentle
strength about the man that had a way of silencing the
most boisterously inclined. He had a quiet humor, too,
that was often far too subtle for the cruder minds of
Barnriff. But most of all his sympathy was a thing that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
left no room for self in his thoughts. No one attempted
undue familiarity with him; not that he would have been
likely to actively resent it, but simply, in his presence
nobody had any inclination that way. Nobody could
have been more a part of the Barnriff community than
Peter Blunt, and yet nobody could have been more apart
from it.</p>
<p>Peter did not even look up from his labors when his
visitor flung himself into the vacant chair. He silently
went on with his examination of first one fragment of
quartz and then another. And the man in the chair
watched him with moody, introspective eyes. It was a
long time before either spoke, and when, at last, the
silence was broken, it was by Peter&rsquo;s deep mellow voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for gold in a heap of dirt, Jim,&rdquo; he said,
without lifting his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find, there&rsquo;s such
a pile of the&ndash;&ndash;dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wash it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose I ought to,&rdquo; Peter allowed.</p>
<p>Then he glanced over, and his mild eyes focused
themselves on the bottle protruding from Jim&rsquo;s pocket.
For some moments he contemplated it, and then he
looked up into his friend&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo; he inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In for a&ndash;&ndash;vacation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim stirred uneasily. There was a directness about
the other&rsquo;s manner that was disconcerting. He laughed
mirthlessly, and shifted his position so that his bottle of
whiskey was concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting back&ndash;&ndash;sometime to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; Then Peter went on after a pause: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
things are going well for you. Restless told me he&rsquo;d
got an order from you for some buildings on your <i>own</i>
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned his eyes in the direction of the doorway
and found them gazing upon Eve Marsham&rsquo;s little home
beyond it. As Peter offered no further comment he was
finally forced to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve just canceled that order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned on him irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, Peter, you heard what I said. I&rsquo;ve canceled
that order. Do you get it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large man nodded. The brains behind his mild
eyes were working swiftly, shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&rsquo;s in town. Been in since yesterday morning,&rdquo;
he said after a while. &ldquo;Seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim suddenly sprang from his seat, the moody fire of
his dark eyes blazing furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen him! Seen him!&rdquo; he cried, with a sudden letting
loose of all the bitterness and smouldering passion
which had been so long pent up. &ldquo;Seen him? I
should say I have. I&rsquo;ve seen him as he really is. I&rsquo;ve
seen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and began to pace the room. Peter was
still at the table. His hands were still raking at the pile
of dirt. His face was quite unmoved at the other&rsquo;s evident
passion; only his eyes displayed his interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! but the thought of him sets me crazy,&rdquo; Jim
went on furiously. Then he paused, and stood confronting
the other. &ldquo;Peter, I came in here without knowing
why on earth I came. I came because something forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
me, I s&rsquo;pose. Now I know what made me come. I&rsquo;ve
got to get it off my chest, and you&rsquo;ve got to listen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s smile was the gentlest thing imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew there was
something you&rsquo;d got that wasn&rsquo;t good for you to hold.
Sort of fancied you&rsquo;d like to get rid of it&ndash;&ndash;here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calm sincerity of the man was convincing. Jim
felt its effect without appreciation, for the hot blood of
bitterness still drove him. His wrongs were still heavy
upon him, water-logging his better sense, and leaving it
rudderless.</p>
<p>He hesitated. It was not that he did not know how
to begin. It was not that he had any doubts in his mind.
Just for a second he wondered at the strange influence
which was forcing his story from him. It puzzled him&ndash;&ndash;it
almost angered him. And something of this anger appeared
in his manner and tone when he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Henderson&rsquo;s a damned traitor,&rdquo; he finally burst out.</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all that,&rdquo; he said gently: &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s only to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want your moralizing,&rdquo; the other cried
roughly. &ldquo;Listen, this is the low, mean story of it.
You&rsquo;ll have little enough moralizing to do when you&rsquo;ve
heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told Peter of their meeting the day before,
and of the friendly honesty of his purpose in the shooting
match. How Will had accepted, shot, and lost. This
part he told with a grim setting of his teeth, and it was
not until he came to the story of the man&rsquo;s treachery
that his manner became intemperate. Then he spoke
with all the color of a strongly passionate temperament,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
when the heart is stirred beyond all reason. And the
giant listened to it, silent and attentive. What thoughts
the story inspired in the listener it would have been impossible
to say. His face was calm. There was no sign
of any enthralled attention. There was no light in his
eyes beyond the kindliness that ever seemed to shine there.
And at its conclusion Jim&rsquo;s underlying feeling, that almost
subconscious thought which hitherto had found expression
only in bitter feeling and the uncertain activities
of his mind, broke out into raving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curse that&rsquo;s on me, Peter!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I tell
you it&rsquo;s a curse! I&rsquo;ve never had a chance. Everything
from the start has been broken just when its completion
was almost achieved. When I look back I can see
it written all along the path I&rsquo;ve trodden, in the ruins I&rsquo;ve
left behind me. Why, why, I ask, am I chosen for
such persecution? What have I done to deserve it? I&rsquo;ve
played the game. I&rsquo;ve worked. God knows how I&rsquo;ve
worked. And everything I&rsquo;ve done has come to nothing,
and not because I&rsquo;ve always made mistakes, or committed
foolishnesses. Every smash has been brought about by
influences that could not have been humanly foreseen. I&rsquo;m
cursed. Cursed by an evil fate it is beyond my power to
fight. God? It almost makes one question. Is there a
God? A good God who permits such a fate to pursue a
man? Is there an all-powerful God, ruling and guiding
every human action? Is there? Is there a God, a merciful,
loving God watching over us, such as kiddies are
taught to believe in? Is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s answer so readily, so firmly spoken was arresting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim. There&rsquo;s a God,&rdquo; he went on, without any
display. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great big God&ndash;&ndash;just such a God as
you and I have knelt to when we were bits of kiddies.
Maybe He&rsquo;s so big that our poor, weak brains can&rsquo;t understand
Him. But He&rsquo;s there, right up above us, and for
every poor mean atom we call &lsquo;man&rsquo; He&rsquo;s set out a trail
to walk on. It&rsquo;s called the One-way Trail. And the
One-way Trail is just the trail of Life. It&rsquo;s chock full
of pitfalls and stumbling-blocks, that make us cuss like
mad. But it&rsquo;s good for us to walk over it. There are
no turnings or by-paths, and no turning back. And,
maybe, when we get to the end something will have been
achieved in His scheme of things that our silly brains can&rsquo;t
grasp. Yes, there is a God, Jim, and you&rsquo;re just hitting
the trail He&rsquo;s set for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim was in no reasonable mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where&rsquo;s the cursed justice&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began
heatedly. But broke off as the other shrugged his great
shoulders.</p>
<p>He waited for Peter to speak. He waited, stirred to
a mad contentiousness, to tear his friend&rsquo;s arguments to
ribbons, and fling their broken remains back in his face.
But no arguments were forthcoming. Peter understood
his temper, and saw the uselessness of argument. Besides,
he could smell the reek of whiskey.</p>
<p>He thought swiftly with all the wisdom of a great
understanding and experience. And finally his manner
changed utterly. He suddenly became cordially sympathetic
with the other&rsquo;s angry mood. He even agreed
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, though, Jim,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Things
have been mighty hard for you. You&rsquo;ve had a heap of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
trouble. I can&rsquo;t say I wonder at you taking it bad, and
thinking things. But&ndash;&ndash;but what are you going to do
now? Buck the game afresh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim did not pause to think. He jumped speedily at the
bait held out to him so subtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll be a
different game. A game most folks out here sure know
how to play. We&rsquo;re most of us life&rsquo;s derelicts. I&rsquo;ll buck
it, Peter, and set the devil dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I know. He&rsquo;s always ready to dance if we
pay for the tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim was lost in his own wild thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s good company, too, Peter,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Devilish good.&rdquo; He laughed at his own humor.
&ldquo;The harder you play the harder and more merrily
he&rsquo;ll dance. We&rsquo;ve got one life. The trail&rsquo;s marked
out for us. And, by gum, we&rsquo;ll live while we can. Why
should we sweat and toil, and have it squeezed out of us
whenever&ndash;&ndash;they think fit? I&rsquo;ll spend every dollar I make.
I&rsquo;ll have all that life can give me. I&rsquo;ll pick the fruit
within my reach. I&rsquo;ll do as the devil, or my stomach,
guides me. I&rsquo;ll have my time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim sat down. He was smiling, but the smile was unreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then? Why, I&rsquo;ll go right down and out, and they
can kick my carcase out to the town &lsquo;dumps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin now,&rdquo; he said, with staggering abruptness.
And he pointed at the bottle in Jim&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; the other was startled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin now,&rdquo; Peter said, with his calm smile.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good company, Jim. Where you go, I&rsquo;ll travel,
too&ndash;&ndash;if it&rsquo;s to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile had vanished from Jim&rsquo;s eyes. For a moment
he wondered stupidly, and during that moment, as
Peter&rsquo;s hand was outstretched for the bottle, he passed it
across to him.</p>
<p>The other took it, and looked at the label. It was a
well-known brand of rye whiskey. And as he looked he
seemed to gather warmth and enthusiasm. It was as
though the sight of the whiskey were irresistible to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rye,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The juice for oiling the devil&rsquo;s
joints.&rdquo; And his lips seemed to smack over the words.</p>
<p>Jim was watching. He didn&rsquo;t understand. Peter&rsquo;s
offer to go with him to hell was staggering, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But
the other went on in his own mildly enthusiastic
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start right here. I&rsquo;ll get two glasses. We&rsquo;ll
drink this up, and then we&rsquo;ll get some more at the saloon,
and&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll paint the town red.&rdquo; He rose and fetched two
glasses from a cupboard and set them on the table. Then
he took his sheath knife from his belt, and, with a skilful
tap, knocked the neck off the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No water,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The stuff&rsquo;ll act quicker. We
want it to get right up into our heads quick. We want
the mad whirl of the devil&rsquo;s dance; we&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, man! Your gait&rsquo;s good enough for me. There&rsquo;s
room for more fools than one in hell. Here! Here&rsquo;s
your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and passed a glass across to Jim, while the
other he held aloft.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, boy,&rdquo; he cried, smiling down into Jim&rsquo;s face
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll give you a toast.&rdquo; The stormy light in the
ranchman&rsquo;s eyes had died out, and in them there lurked a
question that had something like fear in it. But his glass
was not raised, and Peter urged him. &ldquo;A toast, lad
huyk your glass right up, and we&rsquo;ll drink it standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim rose obediently but slowly to his feet, and his glass
was lifted half-heartedly. There was no responsive enthusiasm
in him now; it had gone utterly. Peter&rsquo;s voice
suddenly filled the room with a mocking laugh, and his
toast rang out in tones of sarcasm the more biting for
their very mildness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s abroad. Here&rsquo;s to the devil, because
there&rsquo;s no God and the devil reigns. Nothing we see in
the world is the work of anybody but the devil. The
soil that yields us the good grain, the grass that feeds our
stock, the warm, beneficent sun that ripens all the world,
the beautiful flowers, the magnificent forests, the great
hills, the seas, the rivers, the rain; everything in life. All
the beautiful world, that thrills with a perfect life, that
rolls its way through &aelig;ons of time held in space by a
power that nothing can shake. All the myriads of worlds
and universes we see shining in the limitless billions of
miles of space at night, everything, everything. It is the
arch-fiend&rsquo;s work, for there is no God. Here&rsquo;s to the mad,
red, dancing devil, to whom we go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s glass crashed to the floor. He seized the bottle
of whiskey and served that in the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it, you mad fool!&rdquo; he cried in horror. And
Peter slowly put his whiskey down untasted.</p>
<p>Then the dark, horror-stricken eyes looked into the
smiling blue ones, and in a flash to Jim&rsquo;s troubled mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
came inspiration. There was a long, long pause, during
which eye met eye unflinchingly. Then Jim reached out
a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Peter shook his grizzled head as he gripped the outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said with a quaint smile, &ldquo;real glad you
came along&ndash;&ndash;and stopped me drinking that toast.
Going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. He, too, was smiling now, as he moved
to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you must,&rdquo; Peter went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got work, too.&rdquo; He pointed at his pile of dirt on the
table. &ldquo;You see, there&rsquo;s gold in all that muck, and&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve
got to find it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>EVE AND WILL</h3>
</div>
<p>Elia was staring at his sister with wide, expectant eyes.
Suspense was evidently his dominant feeling at the moment.
A suspense which gave him a sickly feeling in the
pit of the stomach. It was the apprehension of a prisoner
awaiting a verdict; the nauseating sensation of one who
sees death facing him, with the chances a thousand to one
against him. A half-plaited rawhide rope was lying in his
lap; the hobby of making these his sister had persuaded
him to turn to profitable account. He was expert in their
manufacture, and found a ready market for his wares on
the neighboring ranches.</p>
<p>Eve was staring out of the window considering, her
pretty face seriously cast, her eyes far away. Will Henderson,
his boyishly handsome face moodily set, was standing
beside the work-table that occupied the centre of the
living-room, the fingers of one hand restlessly groping
among the litter of dress stuffs lying upon it. He was
awaiting her answer to a question of his, awaiting it in
suspense, like Elia, but with different feelings.</p>
<p>Nor did the girl seem inclined to hurry. To her mind
a lot depended on her answer. Her acquiescence meant
the giving up of all the little features that had crept into
her struggling years of independence. There was her
brother. She must think for his welfare. There was her
business, worked up so laboriously. There was the possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
removal from Barnriff to the world of hills and
valleys, which was Will&rsquo;s world. There were so many
things to think of,&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;yet she knew her answer beforehand.
She loved, and she was a woman, worldly-wise,
but unworldly.</p>
<p>The evening was drawing in, and the soft shadows
were creeping out of the corners of the little room.
There was a gentle mellowness in the twilight which
softened the darns in the patchwork picture the place
presented. This room was before all things her shop;
and, in consequence, comfort and the picturesque were
sacrificed to utility. Yet there was a pleasant femininity
about it. A femininity which never fails to act upon the
opposite sex. It carries with it an influence that can
best be likened, in a metaphoric sense, to a mental aroma
which soothes the jagged edges of the rougher senses.
It lulls them to a gentle feeling of seductive delight, a
condition which lays men so often open to a bad woman&rsquo;s
unscrupulousness, but also to a good woman&rsquo;s influence
for bringing out all that is greatest and best in their
nature.</p>
<p>The waiting was too long for Will. He was a lover
of no great restraint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Eve?&rdquo; he demanded, almost sharply. &ldquo;Two
months to-day. Will you? We can get the parson
feller that comes here from Rocky Springs to&ndash;&ndash;marry
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf brushed his rope out of his lap, and, rising,
hobbled to Eve&rsquo;s side, and stood peering up into her face
in his bird-like way. But he offered no word.</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s hand caressed his silky head. She nodded,
nodded at the distant hills through the window.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Will, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was at her side in an instant, while Elia slunk
away. The youth drew back and turned tail, slinking
off as though driven by a cruel lash in the hand of one
from whom kindness is expected. He did not return to
his seat, but passed out of the house. And the girl and
man, in their moment of rapture, forgot him. At that
moment their lives, their happiness, their love, were the
bounds of their whole thought.</p>
<p>For moments they stood locked in each other&rsquo;s arms,
oblivious to all but the hot passion that ran through their
veins. They were lost in the dream of love which was
theirs. The world was nothing, life was nothing, except
that it gave them this power to love. They drank in each
other&rsquo;s kisses till the woman lay panting in the fierce
embrace of the man, and he&ndash;&ndash;he was devouring her with
eyes which hungered for her, like the eyes of a starving
man, while he crushed her in the arms of a man savage
with the delicious pain of his passion.</p>
<p>At last it was the woman who stirred to release herself.
It is ever the woman who leads where love dominates.
She gently but firmly freed herself. She held his
hands and looked up into his glowing eyes. She had
something to say, something to ask him, and, reluctant
though she be, she must abandon for the time the blissful
moments when their mutual love was burning to the
exclusion of all else. Will&rsquo;s passionate eyes held her,
and for some moments she could not speak. Then, with
an effort, she released his hands and defensively turned her
eyes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I want to speak to you about&ndash;&ndash;Jim,&rdquo; she said at
last, a little hesitatingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>And the fire in the man&rsquo;s eyes abruptly died out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here this morning, and&ndash;&ndash;he was a little
strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will propped himself against the table, and his face,
strangely pale, was turned to the window. Nor did he
see the snow-capped hills which bounded the entire
view. Guilty thoughts filled his mind and crowded out
everything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, as Eve waited for him to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such friends, dear, that I wanted to ask you&ndash;&ndash;Do
you know why he came to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will shook his head. Then a smile struggled round
his clean shaven mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the same reason that makes most fellows crowd
round a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wistful smile that accompanied the girl&rsquo;s
denial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to think it was only that,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you know I am very, very fond of Jim. No, no,
not in the way you mean,&rdquo; she exclaimed hastily, as the
man turned on her, hot with the jealousy which was so
much a part of his Celtic nature. &ldquo;I have always been
fond of Jim. He&rsquo;s so generous; so kind and self-sacrificing.
Do you know, Will, I believe he&rsquo;d give up anything
to you. It is my conviction that his first thought
in life is for your welfare and happiness. And somehow,
it&ndash;&ndash;it doesn&rsquo;t seem right. No, I don&rsquo;t mean that
you don&rsquo;t deserve it, but that&ndash;&ndash;well, don&rsquo;t you think
a man should fight every battle in which he finds himself
on his own account? Don&rsquo;t you think, you who are so
capable, that the struggles that every man must encounter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
in life demand the whole of his energies to bring
them to a successful end? I do. It&rsquo;s not a matter of
self exactly, but we are all so full of weaknesses that this
unselfish way of dividing our energies is apt to weaken
our own defenses. Thus the scheme for our own uplifting,
our own purification, rather suffers. You see, I
think we are here on this earth for the purpose of bettering
ourselves and preparing for that future, which&ndash;&ndash;I
know what I am saying sounds selfish, but really, really,
I don&rsquo;t think it is. Do you know, Jim came to ask me
to marry him? I know he did. I avoided his direct
question, and told him that you asked me last night, and
that I had given you my promise. Well, he accepted it
as though, as though he had no business to want what
you wanted. And his only comment was that you were
a &lsquo;good boy,&rsquo; and that he thought you&rsquo;d make me a
good husband. Now, don&rsquo;t laugh&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the man showed
not the slightest inclination to do so. His face was livid;
there was something like horror in his eyes&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but if I&rsquo;d
been a man in his place I should have been just mad.
Do you think I&rsquo;d have said that? No, Will; my
thoughts would have been murderous. But with him it
was otherwise, I&rsquo;m sure. Yet he loved me, and he was
hurt. I could see it&ndash;&ndash;oh, I could see it. The agony in
his eyes nearly broke my heart. Will, I think we owe
Jim something. I know we can&rsquo;t ever repay it. But we
owe him surely. You do, even more than I. I can&rsquo;t
bear to think of his hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl ceased speaking. Will had made no attempt
to stop her, yet every word she had spoken lashed him to
a savage self-defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know he loved you,&rdquo; he lied. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
stopped with a sickening impulse. But in a moment he
went on. He had taken the plunge, and his selfish nature
came to his aid. &ldquo;Poor Jim,&rdquo; he said, with apparent
feeling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard luck&ndash;&ndash;mighty hard luck. But,
then, Eve, a feller can&rsquo;t expect a man to stand by where
a woman&rsquo;s concerned. Not even a brother. You see,
dear, I love you so bad. I&rsquo;d lose anything but you, yes,
even my life.&rdquo; He drew nearer to her, but the girl made
no response. &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s got to take his &lsquo;medicine.&rsquo; Same
as I&rsquo;d have taken mine, if you&rsquo;d loved him. If Jim
squeals, he&rsquo;s not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid of that,&rdquo; Eve exclaimed, with
some warmth. &ldquo;Jim won&rsquo;t &lsquo;squeal.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not in him to
&lsquo;squeal.&rsquo; He&rsquo;ll take his &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; with any man. I&rsquo;m
not thinking of that. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;only I
think you&rsquo;re lucky to have such a friend, and I&ndash;&ndash;oh, I
wish we could do something for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve did not know how to express all she felt, and Will
did not help her. He displayed no sympathy, but
seemed absolutely indifferent, and she almost felt angry
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done.&rdquo; Then something
prompted the man, and he went on harshly. &ldquo;It was a
fair fight and no favor. I love you, Eve; God knows
how I love you. And I wouldn&rsquo;t give you up or lose
you for fifty Jims. If Jim stood in the way between us
I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;push him out at&ndash;&ndash;any cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will!&rdquo; There was horror in the girl&rsquo;s exclamation.
Then the woman in her rose at the contemplation of the
man&rsquo;s love and passion for her. How could it be otherwise?
She came to him, and was hugged in arms that
almost set her gasping.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, Eve. I love you! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their lips met, and the woman clung to him in the
rush of her responsive passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will,&rdquo; she cried at length. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be
loved as you love. It&rsquo;s so good. Kiss me, dear, kiss
me again. I am all yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man needed no bidding. He had wronged his
friend; had lied, lied in the worst way a man can lie, to
make sure of her. He appreciated the cost, and its value
made those moments all the more precious.</p>
<p>But he had no real regret for the wrong he had committed.
And this was an unerring index to his nature.
He would stand at nothing where his own desires were
at stake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE CHICKEN-KILLING</h3>
</div>
<p>An hour later Will left the house. He felt good. He
felt that he wanted to shout aloud his good fortune. To
a temperament like his there was only one outlet to such
feelings. He would go down to the saloon and treat the
boys. They should share in his good fortune&ndash;&ndash;to the
extent of drink. He cared nothing for them in reality.
He cared nothing for anybody but himself. He wanted
drink, and to treat the boys served as an excuse.</p>
<p>Since winning Eve he had debated with himself the
matter of &ldquo;straightening up&rdquo; with regard to drink. It is
the usual condition of mind upon such occasions amongst
men who live hard. It is an upward moral tendency for
the moment, and often the highest inclination of their
life&rsquo;s moral switchback, the one that inevitably precedes
the longest and severest drop. At no other time would
he have needed an excuse to drink.</p>
<p>He hurried so as not to lose anything of the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment at the saloon, but his way did not take him
direct. He had left the bulk of his money secreted in the
cupboard in his old hut, a place he still kept in which
to sleep when business or pleasure brought him in from
the hunting-grounds of the trade which was his.</p>
<p>But the deviation was considerable, nor had he the assistance
of any outside influence to keep his mind in
focus. Thus he found it drifting whithersoever it chose.
It passed from Eve to the saloon, to the money he required
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to help him pass the evening, to a dozen and one
things, and finally settled itself upon the one subject he
would rather have avoided. It focused itself upon
Jim Thorpe, and, try as he would to break away from
this thrall, it clung tenaciously.</p>
<p>He could not get away from Eve&rsquo;s spoken sympathy
for Jim, and every word he recollected stung him poisonously.
His regard for Jim was of the frailest texture.
He had always regarded him as something inevitable in
his life, and that was all. Nor was he to be considered
in the least where his own desires were concerned. Yet
he cursed that shooting match. He cursed himself for
going to see Jim at all. Why had he not gone to Eve
in the first place? Then he promptly reassured himself
that he had only gone to Jim out of a sense of honor.
Yes, it was that shooting match. Jim had forced it on
him. That was it. It was wholly Jim&rsquo;s fault. How
was he to know he was going to lose? There was no
doubt that Jim was a fine shot, but so was he.</p>
<p>Then through his brain flashed another thought.
Maybe it had inspiration in the thought of Jim&rsquo;s shooting.
What would happen when he met Jim, as, sooner
or later, he knew he must? What would Jim&rsquo;s attitude
be? He frowned heavily. This had not occurred to
him before. Would there be trouble? Well, if there
were it might be easier, at least less complicated. On
the other hand, what else could Jim do? It was uncomfortably
puzzling. His own disposition made it impossible
for him to probe the possibilities of such a nature
as Jim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He could not answer his question, and it left him with
a feeling of apprehension which no prospect of violence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
could have inspired in him. He told himself he was
sorry, regretted the whole occurrence, but there was less
truth in his mental apology than in the feelings which
his thoughts had inspired. Though in his heart he knew
he had done wrong, he had acted with the grossest dishonor
toward Jim, he would not admit it; consequently
he experienced the nervous apprehension which every
wrong-doer, however hardened, always feels at the
thought of being confronted with his crime.</p>
<p>By the time he reached his hut he was in a bad mood.
He not only rebelled against the worry of his thought,
but wanted to vent his feelings. He probably hated Jim
just then, and a meeting with him at that moment would
undoubtedly have provoked a quarrel.</p>
<p>He was approaching his hut from the back. The place
was in darkness, and he groped in his pockets for matches.
He had to pass the old hen-roost, which, in their early
days in Barnriff, had kept him and Jim supplied with
fresh eggs. As he drew abreast of this he suddenly
halted and stood listening. There was a commotion
going on inside, and it startled him. He could hear the
flapping of wings, the scuffling and clucking of the
frightened hens.</p>
<p>For the moment he thought of the coyote, that thieving
scavenger of the prairie which is ever on the prowl
at night. But the next instant he remembered the
chicken killing going on in the village. He ran to the
door of the roost and flung it wide open. Without waiting
for a light he stooped down and made his way in.
And that act of stooping probably saved his life. Something
whistled over his bent body, splitting the air like a
well-swung sword. He knew instinctively it was a knife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
aimed at him. But the next moment he had grappled
with his assailant, and held him fast in his two strong
arms.</p>
<p>From that moment there was no further struggle. As
he dragged his prisoner out he wondered. Then, in a
moment, his wonder passed, as he felt a set of sharp,
strong human teeth fasten themselves upon the flesh of
his forearm. He dropped his hold and with his free
hand seized his captive by the throat and choked him
until the teeth released their grip.</p>
<p>To rush his prisoner along before him to the door of
the hut and thrust him inside was curiously easy. There
was no resistance or struggle for freedom. The captive
seemed even anxious to avoid all further effort. Nor
was there a word spoken until Will had struck a match
and lit the guttered candle stuck in the neck of a whiskey
bottle. Then, with the revealing light, he uttered an
exclamation of blank astonishment.</p>
<p>Elia, Eve&rsquo;s brother, stood cowering before him with
his usually mild eyes filled with such a glare of abject
terror that it might well have inspired pity in the hardest
heart.</p>
<p>But Will was not given to pity. The boy&rsquo;s terror
meant nothing to him. All he remembered was his
unutterable dislike of the boy, and his satisfaction at
having caught the chicken-killer of Barnriff. And, to
judge by the boy&rsquo;s blood-stained hands, in the thick of
his fell work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve caught you, my lad, have I?&rdquo; he said, with
a cold grin of appreciation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who spend your
time killing the chickens? Well, you&rsquo;re going to pay
for it, you&ndash;&ndash;you wretched deformity.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>The boy cowered back. His curious mind was filled
with hatred, but his fear was all-mastering. Will suddenly
reached forward and dragged him further into the
feeble rays of the candle-light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, you young demon!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not going to escape punishment because of your sister.
You haven&rsquo;t got her here to protect you. You&rsquo;ve got a
man to deal with. Do you understand, eh? A man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A devil,&rdquo; Elia muttered, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at this moment, perhaps, a devil!&rdquo; Will
retorted, giving the boy&rsquo;s arm a cruel twist. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; he inquired, as the boy gave one of those curious
cries of pain of his, which had so much likeness to an
animal&rsquo;s yelp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing to what you&rsquo;re going to get,&rdquo; his
persecutor went on. &ldquo;We do the same here to boys
who kill chickens as we do to those who kill and steal
cattle. We hang &rsquo;em, Elia, we hang &rsquo;em. How would
you like to be hanged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will watched the working features. He saw and appreciated
the terror he was causing, the suffering. But
he could draw no further retort.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact he had no definite idea yet as to
what he should do with his captive. He was Eve&rsquo;s
brother, but that did not influence him. He probably
disliked the boy all the more for it, because one day he
would be his brother, and he knew that Elia came before
all else in the world in Eve&rsquo;s thoughts. His jealousy and
hatred were well blended, and, in a man of his mind, this
was a dangerous combination.</p>
<p>He released his hold on his captive and looked at his
bleeding arm. The boy&rsquo;s teeth had left an ugly wound,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
and the blood was flowing freely. He turned his eyes
again to Elia&rsquo;s face and a devil lurked in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to thrash you, you piece of
deformity!&rdquo; he cried angrily. And he made a move
as though to fulfil his threat.</p>
<p>Then that cruel grin gathered round his lips again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thrash you for myself,
and hand you over to those others, after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his words had not the effect which his physical
force had. Perhaps the boy, with that peculiar twist he
possessed, was reading the indecision, the uncertainty in
his captor&rsquo;s mind. Anyway, the terror in his eyes was
becoming less, and a defiant light was taking its place.
But Will could see none of this, and he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be handed over to the boys for hanging&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia suddenly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hangin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and you know it.
You send me to&ndash;&ndash;the others an&rsquo; see what happens to you.
I tell you, sis &rsquo;ud see you dead before she married you.
Guess you best let me go right quick, an&rsquo; no more bulldozing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had suddenly tacked to windward of him, and
Will was confronted with an ugly &ldquo;lee shore.&rdquo; The trap
he had fallen into was difficult, and he stood thinking.
The dwarf had recovered himself, and his bland look of
innocence returned to his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed &rsquo;em nigh all&ndash;&ndash;your chickens,&rdquo; he said earnestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill the rest later, because they&rsquo;re yours. I can&rsquo;t kill
you because you are stronger than me, but I hate you.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; right out of here now, an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t stop
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>But the boy had overreached himself. Will was not
easy when at bay.</p>
<p>He took a step forward and seized him by his two
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate me, eh?&rdquo; he said cruelly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hand
you over to the boys, eh?&rdquo; He wrenched the arms with
a twist at each question, and, at each twist, the boy uttered
that weird cry that was scarcely human. &ldquo;Well, if
I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Will went on through his clenched teeth,
wrenching his arms as he spoke, &ldquo;it cuts both ways;
you&rsquo;ll get your med&rsquo;cine here instead, and you daren&rsquo;t
speak of it&ndash;&ndash;see, see, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s cries were louder and more prolonged.
Terror had again taken its place in his eyes. Yet he
seemed to have no power for resistance. He was held
in a paralysis of unutterable fear. With each of Will&rsquo;s
three final words the lad&rsquo;s arms were nearly wrenched
from their sockets, and, as the victim&rsquo;s final cry broke
louder than the rest, the door was flung open and the
candle set flickering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; cried a voice, directly behind Will, and
the man turned to find the burly form of Peter Blunt filling
the doorway.</p>
<p>But Will was beside himself with rage and hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who says to stop? He&rsquo;s the
chicken-killer. I got him red-handed.&rdquo; He held up one
of the boy&rsquo;s blood-stained hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he is. If you don&rsquo;t loose him
instantly I&rsquo;ll throw you out of this shack.&rdquo; The big man&rsquo;s
voice was calm, but his eyes were blazing.</p>
<p>Will released the boy, but only to turn fiercely upon
the intruder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And who in thunder-are you to interfere?&rdquo; he cried
savagely.</p>
<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Peter walked straight
up to him. For a second he stood towering over him,
eye to eye. Then he turned his back, and thrust out one
great arm horizontally across the other&rsquo;s body, as though
to warn him back while he spoke to Elia. There was
nothing blustering in his attitude, nothing even forceful.
There was a simplicity, a directness that was strangely
compelling. And Will found himself obeying the silent
command in spite of his fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out, laddie,&rdquo; said Peter gently. &ldquo;Get out,
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in those moments while Will watched his prey
hobbling to freedom, he remembered Eve and what it
would mean if the story of his doings reached her.</p>
<p>As the boy vanished through the doorway Peter turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Will,&rdquo; he said, in his amiable way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
far best let him go. When you hurt that boy you hurt
Eve&ndash;&ndash;ter&rsquo;ble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swift protest leaped to Will&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the chickens. He killed &rsquo;em. I caught him
red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, Will,&rdquo; responded the big man easily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
answer for it&ndash;&ndash;somewhere. There&rsquo;s things we&rsquo;ve been
caught doing &lsquo;red-handed&rsquo; by&ndash;&ndash;some one. And we&rsquo;ll
answer for &rsquo;em sure&ndash;&ndash;somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE &ldquo;BOYS&rdquo; OF THE VILLAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>The saloon was well filled, and it was evident from the
atmosphere pervading the place that something unusually
welcome was afoot.</p>
<p>As a rule evenings spent in the saloon at Barnriff were
not gatherings one would readily describe as being &ldquo;gay.&rdquo;
At least it would require a strong imagination to do so.
A slight modification would be best. The Barnriff men
were rarely lightsome, and when they disported themselves
it was generally with a sombre sort of joy. That
was their attitude just now. There was a peculiar earnestness
about them, even in the fact of living. They seemed
to be actuated by a deadly thoroughness which had a
tendency to kill, not so much levity as lightness, and
leave them mourning.</p>
<p>To-night such an atmosphere of sombre joy was prevailing.
It was a similar attitude to that which they
adopted on election day, Independence Day, at a funeral,
or a wedding. It was the way anything out of the ordinary
always affected them.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was Doc Crombie, who was
doctor, veterinary surgeon, horse dealer, and a sort of self-elected
mayor of the place, was going to hold a meeting
in the saloon. He was going to make a formal speech,
and the speech was the point.</p>
<p>Now, if there was one thing Barnriff bowed the knee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
to it was the man who could, and would, make a speech.
It had all the masses&rsquo; love for oratory, and was as easily
swayed by it as a crowd of ignorant political voters. Besides,
Doc Crombie was a tried orator in Barnriff. He
had addressed a meeting once before, and, speaking on
behalf of a church mission, and asking for support of the
cause, he had created a great impression by his stern denunciation
of the ungodly life in Barnriff, and his flowery
laudation of those who allowed themselves to respond to
the call of &ldquo;religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that occasion he said with all the dignity and consequence
of his position at the moment&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t your dogone dollars we want. It&rsquo;s your souls.
D&rsquo;you git that? An&rsquo; when we&rsquo;ve sure got &rsquo;em wot&rsquo;ll we
do with &rsquo;em, you ast? Wal, I don&rsquo;t guess we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; a
cannibal line o&rsquo; business. Nor ain&rsquo;t we goin&rsquo; to stuff &rsquo;em
an&rsquo; set &rsquo;em up as objec&rsquo;s o&rsquo; ridicool to the ungodly hogs
wot wallers in the swill o&rsquo; no adulteratin&rsquo; son-of-a-moose
of a dealer in liver pizen. No, gents, that ain&rsquo;t us. We&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to save &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; I personal guarantees that savin&rsquo;
racket goes. Did I hear any mangy son-of-a-coyote guess
he didn&rsquo;t believe no such guarantee? No, an&rsquo; I guess he
best not. I&rsquo;m a man of peace, as all knows in this yer
city, but I&rsquo;d hate to try an&rsquo; shut out a blizzard in winter by
stuffin&rsquo; that gopher&rsquo;s perforated carkis under the doorjamb
when I was thro&rsquo; with it. I say right here we&rsquo;re
out to save carkises&ndash;&ndash;I mean souls. An&rsquo;, say, fellers, jest
think. Gettin&rsquo; your souls saved for a few measly cents.
Ain&rsquo;t that elegant? No argyment, no kickin&rsquo;. Them
souls is jest goin&rsquo; to be dipped, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll come up white
an&rsquo; shinin&rsquo; out of the waters of righteousness a sight
cleaner than you ever got your faces at Christmas, washin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
in Silas Rocket&rsquo;s hoss trough, even when his hoss soap
was plenty. Think of it, fellers, and I speak speshul to
you whiskey souses wot ain&rsquo;t breathed pure air sence you
was let loose on the same gent&rsquo;s bowel picklin&rsquo; sperrit.
You&rsquo;ll get right to Meetin&rsquo; on Sundays with your boots
greased elegant, an&rsquo; your pants darned reg&rsquo;lar by your
wimmin-folk wot&rsquo;s proud of yer, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t kick when you
blow into a natty game o&rsquo; &lsquo;draw.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll have your kids
lookin&rsquo; up at your fancy iled locks, an&rsquo; your bow-tie, an&rsquo;
in their little minds they&rsquo;ll wonder an&rsquo; wonder how it
come your mouths ain&rsquo;t drippin&rsquo; t&rsquo;baccer juice, an&rsquo; how
they ain&rsquo;t got cow-hided &rsquo;fore the breakfast they mostly
have to guess at, an&rsquo; how it come you&rsquo;re leadin&rsquo; them,
&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; them leadin&rsquo; you, an&rsquo; how their little bellies is
blown out with grub like a litter o&rsquo; prize hogs. Think
of it, fellers, an&rsquo; pass up your measly cents. It ain&rsquo;t the
coin, it&rsquo;s the sperrit we want, an&rsquo; when I think of all these
yer blessin&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m <i>personal</i> guaranteein&rsquo; to the flower o&rsquo;
Barnriff&rsquo;s manhood I almost feel as though I wus goin&rsquo; to
turn on the hose pipe like a spanked kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked till he had half of Barnriff&rsquo;s &ldquo;flower&rdquo; blubbering,
and he had emptied the last cent out of their
pockets, and the mission was set on a sound financial
basis. But as to his guarantee&ndash;&ndash;well, the doctor was well
understood by his fellow citizens, and no one was ever
heard to question its fulfilment.</p>
<p>It was wonderful what a power of persuasion he had in
Barnriff. But then he was an awe-inspiring figure, with
his large luminous eyes and eagle cast of feature. And,
too, words flowed from his lips like words from the pen
of a yellow journal reporter, and his phraseology was almost
as picturesque.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>The boys were gathered waiting for him. There was
anticipatory pleasure in their hang-dog faces. One of
them almost laughed at a light sally from the cheery Gay,
but luckily it was nipped in time by the interposition of
the mean-minded Smallbones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sez it right here, boys,&rdquo; the latter observed, leaning
with his back against the bar, and speaking with the air
of having just arrived at a grave decision. &ldquo;Old Sally
Morby hadn&rsquo;t no right to burry her man in oak. Now I
ast you, Gay, as man to man, if you&rsquo;d know&rsquo;d we was
goin&rsquo; to be ast to ante up fer her grub stake, wot could
you ha&rsquo; done him handsome an&rsquo; moderate fer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay squared his fat shoulders. For the moment he was
important. Moments of importance are always precious,
even in places like Barnriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I can&rsquo;t rightly give it you down to cents without
considerin&rsquo; Restless some,&rdquo; he replied unctuously. &ldquo;But
we did Toby Randall slap-up in ash fer fifty odd dollars.
Then ther&rsquo; was Sadie O&rsquo;Brien. We did her elegant in
soft pine for twenty-eight odd. It &rsquo;ud sure have been
twenty-five on&rsquo;y fer her weight. Y&rsquo;see the planks under
her had to be two inch or she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; fell through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He produced his note-book and rapidly glanced over
the greasy pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;see,&rdquo; he observed, pausing at the entry he had been
looking for, &ldquo;Sally paid us a hundred an&rsquo; forty-seven
dollars an&rsquo; seventy-five cents. I &rsquo;lows that&rsquo;s handsome fer
buryin&rsquo; a hop-headed skite like Charlie Morby was. But
that wus her order, an&rsquo; bein&rsquo; a business man, an&rsquo; takin&rsquo;
pride in my work, I sez to Restless, I sez, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s oak, boy,
oak with silver plate trimmin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; a real elegant inscription
to Charlie on it, tellin&rsquo; folks o&rsquo; virtues he didn&rsquo;t never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
handle when he was livin&rsquo;.&rsquo; He sure didn&rsquo;t deserve
nothin&rsquo; better than an apple bar&rsquo;l, leavin&rsquo; the head open
so he had a chance to dodge the devil when he come
along. An&rsquo; I guess, knowin&rsquo; Charlie, he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; given him
an elegant run fer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; exclaimed Smallbones, peevishly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it. She goes an&rsquo; blows in her wad on a buzzock what ought
to bin drownded in yaller mud, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve got to ante her
grub stake. Psha! I ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lean Wilkes, the baker, was watching the trust schemer
with baleful eye, and now his slow tongue evolved a pretty
retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one sed you was&ndash;&ndash;nor thought it likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duff puncher wakin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; sneered Smallbones,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s your voice hurtin&rsquo; my ear drums,&rdquo; replied
Jake, ponderously.</p>
<p>At that moment Abe Horsley joined the group. He
called for drinks before adding his bit to the talk. He
had an axe to grind and wanted a sympathetic audience.
While Rocket, observing his customers with shrewd unfriendly
eyes, set out the glasses and the accompanying
bottles&ndash;&ndash;he never needed to inquire what these men
would take; he knew the tipple of every soul in Barnriff
by heart&ndash;&ndash;Abe opened out. He was unctuous and careful
of his diction. He was Barnriff&rsquo;s lay-preacher, and
felt that this attitude was &ldquo;up to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do sure agree with the generality of opinion in this
yer city,&rdquo; he said largely. &ldquo;I consider that the largeness
of heart for which our brothers in this important town&ndash;&ndash;it
has a great future, gentlemen, believe me; I mention
this in parenthesis&ndash;&ndash;are held in excellent esteem&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
He broke off to nod to Jim Thorpe who entered the
saloon at that moment&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;should be&ndash;&ndash;er fostered. I
think, brethren&ndash;&ndash;pardon me, &lsquo;gentlemen&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that we
should give, and give liberally to Sally Morby, but&ndash;&ndash;but
I do not see why Doc Crombie should make the occasion
the opportunity for a speech. Any of us could do it
quite as well. Perhaps, who knows, some of us even
better&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smallbones,&rdquo; murmured the dissatisfied Wilkes, drinking
his gin at a gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even Smallbones,&rdquo; shrugged Abe, sipping his
whiskey.</p>
<p>Angel Gay bolted his whiskey and laid a gentle hand
firmly on Horsley&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not Smallbones; not even Doc
Crombie, both deadgut fellers sure. But you are the
man, Abe. For elegance o&rsquo; langwidge, an&rsquo; flow&ndash;&ndash;mark
you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you are a born speaker, sure. Say, I believe
that rye of Rocket&rsquo;s was in a gin bottle. It tasted like&ndash;&ndash;like&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have another?&rdquo; suggested Abe, cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say &lsquo;no,&rsquo;&rdquo; Gay promptly acquiesced.</p>
<p>But Rocket was serving drink to Jim Thorpe at one
of the little poker tables on the far side of the room, and
the butcher had to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much are you givin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Smallbones inquired
cautiously of Gay.</p>
<p>He was still worrying over the forthcoming demand
on his charity. Gay Promptly puffed himself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; he said, with some dignity. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;see she&rsquo;s got
six kiddies, each smaller nor the other. They mustn&rsquo;t
starve for sure. Guess I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; twenty-fi&rsquo; dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wot?&rdquo; almost shrieked the disgusted Smallbones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the butcher-undertaker coldly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>I</i>
ain&rsquo;t no trust magnate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right up to you, Smallbones,&rdquo; remarked Abe,
passing his friend Gay his drink. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll natcherly give
fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Abe&rsquo;s ponderous levity was too much for Smallbones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if I did it wouldn&rsquo;t be in answer to the hogwash
preachin&rsquo; you ladle out. Anyways I&rsquo;ll give as it
pleases me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess them kiddies&rsquo;ll starve, sure,&rdquo; remarked
Wilkes heavily.</p>
<p>How much further the ruffled tempers of these men
might have been tried it is impossible to say, but at that
moment a diversion was created by the advent of the
redoubtable doctor. And it was easy to see at a glance
how it was this man was able to sway the Barnriff crowd.
He was an aggressive specimen of unyielding force, lean,
but powerful of frame, with the light of overwhelming
determination in a pair of swift, bright eyes.</p>
<p>He glanced round the vast dingy bar-room. There
were two tables of poker going in opposite corners of the
room, and a joyous collection of variegated uncleanness
&ldquo;bucking&rdquo; a bank in another corner. Then there was
the flower of Barnriff propping up the bar like a row
of daisies in a window box&ndash;&ndash;only they lacked the purity
of that simple flower. He stepped at once to the centre
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse, rasping voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a
hurry. Guess natur&rsquo; don&rsquo;t wait fer nuthin&rsquo; when she gits
busy on matters wot interest her; an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; Barnriff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
needs all the population that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to it with so
energetic a funeral maker as our friend, Angel Gay,
around, I&rsquo;ll git goin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m right here fer dollars fer pore
Sally Morby. She&rsquo;s broke, dead broke, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s got six
kiddies, all with their pore little bellies flappin&rsquo; in the
wind for want of a squar&rsquo; feed. Say, I ain&rsquo;t hyar to git
gassin&rsquo;, I ain&rsquo;t hyar to make flowery talk fer the sake o&rsquo;
them pore kiddies. I&rsquo;m here to git dollars, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to git &rsquo;em. Cents won&rsquo;t do. Come on. Ther&rsquo;s six pore
kiddles, six pore lone little kiddies with their faces gapin&rsquo;
fer food like a nest o&rsquo; unfledged chicks in the early frosts o&rsquo;
spring. Now every mother&rsquo;s son o&rsquo; you &lsquo;ante&rsquo; right here.
Natur&rsquo; busy or no natur&rsquo; busy, I don&rsquo;t quit till you&rsquo;ve
dipped into your wads. Now you, Smallbones,&rdquo; he
cried, fixing the little man with his desperate eyes.
&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye was on the trust manipulator. He hated
it. He hated them all, but Doc Crombie most of all.
But the tall, lean man was impatient. He knew it was a
race between him and a baby in a distant quarter of the
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he threatened the hesitating man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dollar,&rdquo; Smallbones muttered in the midst of profound
silence. Even the chips of the poker players had
ceased to rattle.</p>
<p>A faint light of amusement crept into every eye, every
eye except the doctor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Suddenly his lean figure pounced forward and stood
before the beflustered speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;how much?&rsquo;&rdquo; he rasped, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause Barnriff
knows its manners. Wal, the social etiquette o&rsquo; Barnriff
is satisfied, so I ken talk straight. Say, you an&rsquo; me have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
piled a tidy heap in this yer city, so I guess you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
to match my hundred dollars right here. An&rsquo; I tel
you squar&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a man o&rsquo; my word, if you don&rsquo;t
you&rsquo;ll get a bath in Rocket&rsquo;s hoss-trough which&rsquo;ll do you
till the next Presidential Election&ndash;&ndash;if it pizens every hoss
for miles around Barnriff. Guess I&rsquo;ll take that hundred
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did. The furious Smallbones &ldquo;weighed out&rdquo;
amid a circle of smiles, which suddenly seemed to light
up the entire bar-room. Nor had he a single spoken
word of protest. But he yielded himself up to the demands
of the masterful doctor only to save himself the
ducking he was certain awaited his refusal.</p>
<p>The rest was play to Doc Crombie. As he had
pointed out, Barnriff&rsquo;s social demands had been satisfied
by his giving Smallbones the option of stating the
amount of his contribution, and, as the result had not
come up to requirements, he dispensed with further
delicacy, and assessed each man present with the cool
arbitrariness of a Socialist Chancellor. But in this case
the process was not without justification. He knew just
how much each man could afford, and he took not one
cent more&ndash;&ndash;or less.</p>
<p>This fact was exampled when he came to Jim&rsquo;s table.
Jim looked up from his cards. He understood Crombie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Doc,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crombie eyed him with shrewd amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, Jim, I&rsquo;ll take on&rsquo;y ten dollars from you, seein&rsquo;s
your contrac&rsquo;s out for buildin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; you need ev&rsquo;rything
that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim laughed. It was a boisterous laugh that had little
mirth in it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll treble that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cut the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the laugh had irritated the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take ten from you;&rdquo; he said, with an incisive
clipping of his teeth. &ldquo;Not a cent more, nor a cent less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jim yielded to him promptly. The doctor passed
on. Neither he nor those around him had understood
the bitter humor underlying Jim&rsquo;s laugh. Only, perhaps,
Peter Blunt, who had entered the room with Will
Henderson a moment or two before, and whose sympathetic
ears had caught the sound, could possibly have interpreted
it aright.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;whip round&rdquo; was completed, and the doctor read
out the total. Five hundred and forty dollars was to be
handed over to the widow, to ease the burden Fate had
inflicted upon her. And it said something for the big
hearts of this prairie folk, that, in the large majority at
least, the memory of their charity left them with the departure
of the doctor to complete his race with Nature at
the far extremity of the village.</p>
<p>The saloon settled down to its evening&rsquo;s entertainment
as though nothing unusual had happened. The majority
gathered into various games of &ldquo;draw,&rdquo; for which the
great room was half filled with small tables. The few
that resisted the seductive charms of the national card
game continued to support the bar. Of these, Smallbones
only remained long enough to air his spleen at the
doctor&rsquo;s expense. But even he found it incumbent upon
him to modify his tone. For one thing he received an
unmerciful baiting from his companions, and besides, he
knew, if he allowed his tongue to riot too far, how easy it
would be for his denunciation to reach the strenuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
doctor&rsquo;s ears. Gay and Wilkes left shortly after the trust
magnate, and soon Abe Horsley was forced to seek a fresh
gossip. He found one in Will Henderson, as soon as
Peter Blunt had moved away to watch the games at the
tables. Will&rsquo;s mood at the moment suited the lay-preacher.
He wanted to drink, and Abe was possessed
of a chronic thirst.</p>
<p>So, with the exception of these two, Silas Rocket, ever
rapacious for custom, was left free to see that the games
did not detract from the men&rsquo;s drinking powers. He had
an eye like a hawk for possible custom. Wherever there
was a big pot just won his rasping voice was always at
the elbow of the winner, with his monotonous &ldquo;Any
drinks, gents?&rdquo; If a table was slow to require his
services he never left it alone. He drove the men at it to
drink in self-defense. It was a skilful display&ndash;&ndash;though
not as uncommon as one might think, even in the best
restaurants in a big metropolis.</p>
<p>So the night wore on. Every man drank. They
drank when they won. They drank when they lost. In
the former case it was out of the buoyancy of their spirits,
in the latter because they wished to elevate them. Whatever
excuse they required they found, and when difficulty
in that direction arose, there was always Silas Rocket on
hand to coax them.</p>
<p>Jim, huddled away in a corner behind the great stove
used for heating the place in winter, was busy with his
game. He had shown no recognition of Will Henderson&rsquo;s
coming. He had probably seen him, because,
though hidden from it himself, he had a full view of the
bar, and any time he looked up, his eyes must have encountered
the two figures now left alone beside it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>He was drinking, and drinking hard. He was also
losing. The cards were running consistently against him.
But then, he was always an unlucky player. He rarely
protested against it, for in reality he had little interest in
the play, and to-night less than usual. He played because
it saved him thinking or talking, and he wanted to
sit there and drink until Silas turned them out. Then he
intended returning to the ranch. He meant to have one
night&rsquo;s forgetfulness, at least, even if he had to stupefy his
senses in bad whiskey.</p>
<p>Abe and Will had reached the confidential stage.
They were full of friendliness for each other, and ready to
fall on each other&rsquo;s necks. For some time Will had desired
an opportunity to open his heart to this man. He
would have opened it to anybody. His Celtic temperament
was a fire of enthusiasm. He felt that all the world
was his, and he wanted to open his arms and embrace it.
But so far Abe had given him little opportunity. His
own voice pleased the lay-preacher, and he had orated on
every subject from politics to street-paving, giving his
companion little chance for anything but monosyllabic
comments. But finally Will&rsquo;s chance came. Abe had
abruptly questioned the propriety of permitting marriage
in their village, where the burden of keeping the offspring
of the union was likely to fall upon the public shoulders.
Will plunged into the midst of the man&rsquo;s oratory, and
would not be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is not for regulation by law. No
one has the right,&rdquo; he declared, with an emphatic thump
on the bar, &ldquo;to dictate to the individual on the subject.&rdquo;
He went on at high pressure in a heated crescendo for
some moments, denouncing any interference by public
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
bodies. Then of a sudden he laid a hand on Abe&rsquo;s
shoulder and abruptly dropped his voice to a confidential
whisper. His eyes were smiling and shining with the
feelings which stirred him. Everything was forgotten
except the fact of his engagement to Eve. Jim was
obscured from his mental vision by the uplifting spirit
vapors which supported his thoughts. Eve, and Eve
alone, was in his mind, that&ndash;&ndash;and the fact that she was to
be&ndash;&ndash;his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Abe,&rdquo; he said, a little thickly. &ldquo;All
this talk of yours don&rsquo;t hold water&ndash;&ndash;no, nor spirit either,&rdquo;
he laughed. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get married, and so I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite how he knew didn&rsquo;t seem clear; but he paused
for the impression. Abe whistled interestedly and edged
nearer, turning his ear so as not to miss what the youngster
had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-ah!&rdquo; Will prolonged the exclamation knowingly,
and waited for the man to guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wus allus sweet on Eve Marsham&ndash;&ndash;you and Jim
Thorpe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will suddenly ceased to smile. He drank his whiskey
at a gulp and banged his glass on the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By G&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; he exclaimed harshly, while Abe
wondered at his changed tone. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Eve&ndash;&ndash;Eve
Marsham; and I&rsquo;m going to marry her&ndash;&ndash;not Jim. D&rsquo;you
git that? By heaven!&ndash;&ndash;yes. Here, Rocket&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; He
lurched round on the bar. &ldquo;Here, you old Sky-Rocket,
get drinks, quick! For everybody! I&rsquo;ll pay! See,
here&rsquo;s the wad,&rdquo; and he slammed a thick roll of bills on
the counter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got money, sure, and I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;hic&ndash;&ndash;goin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
to burn it. Boys,&rdquo; he cried, swinging about and
facing the tables, supporting himself against the bar,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll drink with me. Si&ndash;&ndash;Silas here&rsquo;ll take your
orders, an&rsquo; serve you. You, too, Abe, ole pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked up from his cards the moment Will addressed
the room, and now he watched him swaying
against the bar. The light in his dark eyes was peculiar.
He seemed to be speculating, and his thoughts were uneasy.
Will yawned drunkenly. Peter Blunt, from across
the room, was watching Jim, and moved abruptly clear
of the tables, but not ostentatiously so.</p>
<p>Will&rsquo;s eyes watched Silas passing round the drinks.
He was smiling in the futile manner of a drunken man,
and his fingers were clutching nervously at the moulded
edge of the bar. Rocket came back and handed him and
Abe their whiskey. The former promptly clutched his
glass and raised it aloft, spilling the neat spirit as he did
so. Then, with drunken solemnity, he called for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll drink a to&ndash;&ndash;toast.
Sure you will. Every one of you&rsquo;ll drink it. My fu&ndash;&ndash;sher
wife, Eve&ndash;&ndash;Eve Marsham. Jim Th&ndash;&ndash;Thorpe
thought he&rsquo;d best&ndash;&ndash;me, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A table was suddenly sent flying in the crowd. A
man&rsquo;s figure leaped out from behind the stove and rushed
up to the speaker. It was Jim Thorpe. His eyes were
blazing, and a demon of fury glared out upon the drunken
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word, and I&rsquo;ll shoot you like a dog! You
liar! You thieving&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his sentence was never completed. Peter Blunt
stood between them, one of his great hands gripping Jim&rsquo;s
arm like a vice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he cried, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have the whole story all over the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the mischief was done. Everybody present was
on their feet agog with excitement, and came gathering
round to see the only possible finish to the scene, as they
understood it. But, quick as lightning, Peter took in the
situation. Flinging Jim aside as though he were a baby,
he hugged the drunken Will Henderson in his two great
arms, and carried him bodily out of the saloon.</p>
<p>The men looked after him wondering. Then some
one laughed. It was an odd, dissatisfied laugh, but it had
the effect of relieving the tension. And one by one they
turned back to Jim, who was standing moodily leaning on
the bar; his right hand was still resting on the gun on
his hip.</p>
<p>There was a moment of suspense. Then Jim&rsquo;s hand
left the gun, and he straightened himself up. He tried to
smile, but the attempt was a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for upsetting your game, boys,&rdquo; he said
stupidly.</p>
<p>Then Rocket came effectively to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll all honor me by drinkin&rsquo;
with the house.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN&rsquo;S CARE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right now, Eve, dear&ndash;&ndash;right <i>as</i> right. He&rsquo;ll sleep
till morning, and then he&rsquo;ll wake up, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; forget about
being ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not so much the words as the tone that brought
comfort to Eve. She was leaning over her brother&rsquo;s bed
watching the beautiful face, so waxen now, and listening to
his heavy breathing, which was steadily moderating to a
normal ease. The boy was sleeping the result of a dose
administered to him by Doc Crombie who had been
urgently summoned immediately after winning his race
with Nature in another part of the village. Elia had been
prostrated with a nervous attack which ended in a terrible
fit, and Eve, all unaware of what had gone before between
her brother and Will, had been hard put to it, in her grief
and anxiety.</p>
<p>When the boy first showed signs of illness she sent
for Mrs. Gay to find the doctor, and the bright, busy
little woman was still with her. Annie Gay was quite
the antithesis of her husband. She was practical, energetic
and, above all things, bright. She was quite young
and pretty, and Eve and she were considerable friends.
She answered the girl&rsquo;s summons without a moment&rsquo;s delay,
and, to her utmost distress, when she arrived, she
found Elia in a fierce paroxysm of convulsions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so, Annie?&rdquo; Eve&rsquo;s eyes lifted hungrily to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
her friend&rsquo;s face. They were full of almost painful yearning.
This boy&rsquo;s welfare meant more to her than any one
knew.</p>
<p>Annie took her arm, and gently drew her from the
bedside, nodding her pretty head sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Then she added with a great assumption of
knowledge, &ldquo;You see those weakly creatures like poor
Elia have got a lot o&rsquo; life in them. You can&rsquo;t kill &rsquo;em.
Angel allus says that, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sure to know. Elia&rsquo;s body
ain&rsquo;t worth two cents as you might say, but he&rsquo;s got&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s
the word&ndash;&ndash;vi&ndash;&ndash;vi&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vitality,&rdquo; suggested Eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure. That&rsquo;s it. Now he&rsquo;ll just sleep and sleep.
And then he&rsquo;ll be bully when he wakes. So come you
and sit down while I make you a drop of hot coffee.
Pore girl, you&rsquo;re wore out. There&rsquo;s no end to the
troubles o&rsquo; this world for sure,&rdquo; she added cheerfully, as
she hustled off to the kitchen to get the promised coffee.</p>
<p>Eve sat down in her workroom. She was comforted
in spite of herself. Annie Gay&rsquo;s manner was of an order
that few could resist; it was illogical, and, perhaps, foolishly
optimistic, yet it had that blessed quality of carrying conviction
to all who were fortunate enough to lean on her
warm, strong heart. And on Eve she practiced her best
efforts.</p>
<p>But Eve&rsquo;s anxiety only lay dormant for the time. It
was still there gnawing at her heart. She knew the danger
of the fits Elia was subject to and a brooding thought
clung to her that one day one of these would prove fatal.
The least emotion, the least temper, fear, excitement,
brought them on. This one&ndash;&ndash;it was the worst she had
known. Supposing he had died&ndash;&ndash;she shuddered. Like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
a saving angel Annie re&euml;ntered with the coffee in time
to interrupt her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dear, you drink this at once,&rdquo; she said. Then
she went on, in response to a mute inquiry, &ldquo;Oh, yes,
there&rsquo;s plenty here for me. And when I come back I&rsquo;m
going to make some more, and cook a nice light supper,
while you watch the boy, and we can sit here together
with his door open until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to stop, Annie,&rdquo; Eve protested.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have that. You must get your sleep. It&rsquo;s very
kind of you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look right here, Eve,&rdquo; the busy woman said
decidedly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got nothing to say about it, please.
Do you think I could sleep in my bed with you fretting
and worrying your poor, simple heart out? What if he
woke up in the night an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; had another? Who&rsquo;s to
go and fetch Doc? Now wot I says is duty&rsquo;s duty, and
Angel Gay can just snore his head off by himself for once,
and I&rsquo;m not sure but what I shall be glad to be shut of
the noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genuine sympathy and kindliness were quite touching,
and Eve responded to it as only a woman can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie,&rdquo; she said, with a wistful smile, &ldquo;you are the
kindest, dearest thing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you call me a &lsquo;thing,&rsquo; Eve Marsham,&rdquo; the
other broke in with a laugh, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll quarrel. I&rsquo;m just
a plain woman with sense enough to say nothing when
Gay gets home with more whiskey aboard than is good
for his vitals. And don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m not putting a
good value on myself when I say that. Not that Gay&rsquo;s
given to sousing a heap. No, he&rsquo;s a good feller, sure, an&rsquo;
wouldn&rsquo;t swap him for&ndash;&ndash;for your Will&ndash;&ndash;on&rsquo;y when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
snores. So you see it&rsquo;s a kindness to me letting me stop
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; Eve cried warmly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;thing.&rsquo; Where are you going now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to set Angel&rsquo;s cheese an&rsquo; pickles, and
put his coffee on the stove. If he&rsquo;s to home when I get
around, maybe I&rsquo;ll sit with him ten minutes or so, an&rsquo;
then I&rsquo;ll come right along back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had reached the door, which stood open, and now
she paused, looking back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you gettin&rsquo; married, Eve?&rdquo; she demanded
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months to-day,&rdquo; the other replied. She was
surprised out of herself, and for a moment a warm glow
swept over her as she realized that there was something
still in the world which made for other than unhappiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; said Annie, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Two
months, eh?&rdquo; Then she suddenly became mysterious
and smiled into the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be nice time
for Gay to think about something that ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;a coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried out on her mission of duty and affection.
Gay was her all, but she had room in her heart for a good
deal more than the worthy butcher-undertaker&rsquo;s great, fat
image. She had no children of her own yet, but, as she
often said, in her cheery, optimistic way, &ldquo;time enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her attitude toward all things, and it carried her
through life a heaven-sent blessing to all those who could
number her amongst their friends. To Eve she had certainly
been all this and more, for when a woman, alone
in the world, is set the appalling task of facing the struggle
for existence which is called Life, without the necessary
moral and physical equipment for such a battle, the support
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
of a strong heart generously given surely becomes
the very acme of all charity.</p>
<p>After drinking her coffee, Eve went to the open door
and stood looking out upon the village. It was a warm
summer night, and the scent of the prairie was strong
upon the air. As yet Barnriff was neither large enough,
nor shut in enough by its own buildings to hold to itself
that stale, stifling atmosphere which cities obtain. The
air was the pure breath which swept over the vast green
rollers of the grass world in the midst of which it stood.</p>
<p>The velvet heavens, clad in their perfect tinsel of a
glorious night, spread a softness over the world upon
which she gazed. An odd light or two twinkled from a
tiny window here and there; and, then, like a vulgar
centerpiece, the lights of the saloon stared out harshly.
There was no moon, but the mellow sheen of the stars
hid the roughness from the mind, and conveyed an added
peace.</p>
<p>The girl breathed a deep sigh. It was an expression
of relief, of something almost like content. And it told
of what Annie Gay&rsquo;s coming had meant to her. As
though suddenly released from an insufferable burden her
heart cheered, and hope told her that her brother would
recover; and, in her relief, she gazed up at the starlit sky
and thanked the great God who controlled those billions
of sparkling worlds.</p>
<p>With each passing moment her mood lightened, and
her thoughts inevitably turned upon those happier things
which had been nearly obscured. She was thinking of
Will, and wondering what he was doing. Was he in bed?
Was he sleeping and dreaming of her? Or was he
awake and thinking of their love, planning for their joint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
future? Her eyes drifted in the direction of his old hut,
where she knew he was to pass the night. It was in darkness.
Yes, he was a-bed, she told herself. Then she
smiled. An idea had flashed through her mind. Should
she walk over to the hut, and&ndash;&ndash;and listen at the open
window for the sound of his breathing?</p>
<p>Her smile brought with it a blush of modesty, and the
idea passed. Then with its going her eyes turned away,
and, suddenly, they became fixed upon the indistinct outline
of the gate in the fencing of her vegetable patch.
She could just make out the figure of a man standing on
the far side of it. For the moment the joyous thought
that it was Will came to her. Then she negatived the
idea. The outline was too large. She thought for a
moment, and then, in a low voice, called the man by
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter? That you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gate opened, and the man&rsquo;s heavy tread came up
the narrow path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, as he came. &ldquo;I was just passing, and
I thought I saw you in the doorway.&rdquo; He had reached
the house, and with Eve standing on the door-sill, his
rugged face was on a level with hers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of
late up, Eve,&rdquo; he went on doubtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
made me stop. There&rsquo;s nothing amiss with&ndash;&ndash;Elia?&rdquo; he
asked, shrewdly.</p>
<p>It was by no means a haphazard question. He knew
what the lad had been through that night. He knew,
too, the boy&rsquo;s peculiar nervous temperament and its possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you ask?&rdquo; Eve retorted sharply. She
knew something must have happened to the boy, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
wondering if Peter knew what it was. &ldquo;Why should
Elia be ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter scratched his rough, gray head. His mild, blue
eyes twinkled gently in the lamplight from within the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, seeing you were up&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But there, I&rsquo;m glad
it&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;ll pass on.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;You see,
when a pretty girl gets standing in the doorway late at
night&ndash;&ndash;and such a lovely summer night&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;s just&ndash;&ndash;just
engaged, I don&rsquo;t guess she wants the company of six
foot three of a misspent life. Good-night, Eve, my dear.
My best congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl wanted him. Now he was here she wanted
to talk to him particularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Peter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something is the matter
with Elia. He is ill&ndash;&ndash;very ill. He&rsquo;s had the worst fit
I&rsquo;ve ever known him to have, and&ndash;&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t know if
he&rsquo;s going to pull round when he wakes up. He was out
late this evening, and I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s been, or&ndash;&ndash;or
what happened to him while he was out. Something
must have happened to him. I mean something to upset
him&ndash;&ndash;either to anger him, or to terrify him. I wish I
knew. It would help me perhaps when he wakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s smile had gone. His eyes were full of sympathy.
There was also a shadow of trouble in them, too. But
Eve did not see it, or, if she did, her understanding was
at fault. They stood there for some moments in silence,
he so massive yet so gentle, she so slight and pretty, yet
so filled with a concern which harassed her mind and
heart. Peter was thinking very hard, and though he
could have told her all she wanted to know, though his
great heart ached for her at the knowledge which was his,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
he refrained from saying a word that could have betrayed
the boy&rsquo;s secret, and the hideous aspect he had witnessed
of the man she was going to marry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had the Doc to him?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes. Doc dosed him to make him sleep.
Annie Gay&rsquo;s been with me helping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s a good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s more than that. She&rsquo;s as near an angel as
human nature will let her be.&rdquo; Then Eve abruptly
changed her tone, and it became almost appealing.
&ldquo;Tell me, Peter, what do you think could have happened
to Elia? I mean, to shock him so. I&rsquo;ve tried and tried,
but I can&rsquo;t think&ndash;&ndash;nor can Annie. You know all the
boys, you go amongst them, you may have heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter was ready, and answered her with such
simple sincerity that she could not question him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, Eve, if the boy has had any trouble, or shock,
he&rsquo;ll tell you of it when he wakes&ndash;&ndash;if he wants you to
know. I don&rsquo;t reckon if I did know that I&rsquo;d have a right
to speak while he&ndash;&ndash;he was asleep. I say&ndash;&ndash;if I did know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Then the girl smiled up into his face a little
whimsically. &ldquo;You men have a curious code of honor
in your dealings with each other. Quite different to us
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t the same perspective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eastern horizon was lighting with a golden shadow
and the sky-line was faintly silhouetted against it. It was
the soft, effulgent light which heralded the full, rising
moon. Eve watched it in silence for some moments.
Peter followed the direction of her eyes while he went on
speaking.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When are you getting married, Eve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know. Of course you know. You always
seem to know, and yet you don&rsquo;t seem to nose about like
Anthony Smallbones. I&rsquo;m going to be married in two
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s mild eyes were kept intently fixed on the
lightening horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; he said, pondering. &ldquo;And Elia?
What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started. She turned on him, and her pretty
eyes were wide with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make no difference,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden
coldness she could not have accounted for. &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s great shoulders shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It kind of seemed a
natural question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone brought immediate contrition to the girl&rsquo;s
warm heart. This man was always kind to her. It would
have been difficult to remember a single week since she
had lived in Barnriff which had not witnessed at least one
small kindness from him. Her eyes wandered over her
garden. He had not long finished digging it over for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was a natural question,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;only I&ndash;&ndash;well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me as if there could be
any question about Elia. Wherever I am, he will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, just so. He&rsquo;ll still live with you&ndash;&ndash;you and
Will. Y&rsquo;see, I was only thinking. If&ndash;&ndash;if you wanted a
home for him for a while, while you and Will were&ndash;&ndash;honeymooning,
now. Why, he&rsquo;d be real welcome in my
shack. He&rsquo;d want for nothing, and I&rsquo;d look after him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
same as&ndash;&ndash;well, not perhaps as well as you could, but I&rsquo;d
do my best. Y&rsquo;see, Eve, I like the boy. And, and his
very weakness makes me want to help him. You know
he&rsquo;d get good food. I&rsquo;m rather particular about my food,
and I cook it myself. He&rsquo;d have eggs for breakfast, and
good bacon, not sow-belly. And there&rsquo;s no hash in my
shanty. The best meat Gay sells, and he could have all
the canned truck he liked. Oh, I&rsquo;d feed him well. And
I&rsquo;ve always got a few dollars for pocket money. Y&rsquo;see,
Eve, folks honeymooning don&rsquo;t want a third party around,
even if he&rsquo;s a sick boy. I&rsquo;d take it a real favor if you said
&lsquo;yes,&rsquo; I would, true. I can look after&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man felt one of her warm hands squeezing his
arm with the tenderest pressure. There was a moisture
in her eyes as she sought his, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, Peter, I don&rsquo;t know where you come from, I
don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re here, unless it is to help us all to
be better folks. I know why you want to take Elia off
my hands. I know, and the matter has troubled me
some. Elia doesn&rsquo;t like Will. I know that. But Elia is
my care, he&rsquo;s more&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s my life. He will be with me
as long as we both live, even&ndash;&ndash;yes, even if I had to give
Will up. I can&rsquo;t tell you, Peter, what my poor weakly
brother is to me. If anything happened to him I think
it would break my heart. And it seems so strange to me
that everybody, that is everybody but Jim Thorpe and
you, dislikes him. Even Will does a little, I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You can&rsquo;t say how it is,&rdquo; Peter nodded. &ldquo;But
folks can&rsquo;t be blamed for their likes and dislikes. Maybe
Will will get over it. Y&rsquo;see he&rsquo;s just a wild sort of Irish
boy. He&rsquo;s just quicksilver. Yes, yes, he&rsquo;ll maybe grow
to be as fond of the lad as you, Eve. But any time you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
find you&rsquo;d like me to have him for a bit&ndash;&ndash;I mean&ndash;&ndash;sort
of&ndash;&ndash;two&rsquo;s company, you know&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll just be making me
a happy man&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a cheery voice behind him that caused his exclamation.
Annie Gay stepped briskly up the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Peter!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Now if it had
been Will,&rdquo; she added slyly. &ldquo;But there, young engaged
girls think they&rsquo;re safe from scandalous tongues like
mine. Going, Peter? I&rsquo;ve just been down to the meat
store and stolen an elegant bit of tripe. Now, if Eve&rsquo;s
only sensible and got some onions, why there&rsquo;s a lunch
fit for the President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve got onions,&rdquo; Eve reassured her. Then
she turned to the man. &ldquo;Good-bye, Peter,&rdquo; she said, as
he edged away, &ldquo;and thank you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter would have no thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, Eve, I&rsquo;d take it a favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he vanished in the darkness leaving Annie looking
at Eve, who instantly began to explain as they went
indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks Elia will be in the way when Will and I
are married,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wants to look after him.
Isn&rsquo;t he kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Annie&rsquo;s merry eyes were deadly serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I couldn&rsquo;t think of it. I could never let
him go. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve Marsham, you&rsquo;re a&ndash;&ndash;fool, and now I&rsquo;ve said it.
Do you know why Peter wants&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off in confusion. But she had successfully
aroused Eve&rsquo;s curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? Go on,&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>But Annie shook a decided head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter. I was only thinking my own
thoughts, and they began one way and finished another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they finish?&rdquo; Annie&rsquo;s manner was quaintly
amusing and Eve found herself smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just called you a fool, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d forgot to include
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor could she be induced to speak further on the
matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>AN EVIL NIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Peter lumbered heavily away from the house. He had
known the futility of his request beforehand. Yet he
had to make it even on the smallest chance. And now,
more than ever, in spite of his disappointment, he saw
how imperative it was that some one should stand by to
help any one of these three. Old &ldquo;saws&rdquo; were not for
him. The world-old advice to the would-be interferer
might be for those of less thought, less tact. Besides, he
had no intention of interfering. He only meant to
&ldquo;stand by.&rdquo; That was the key-note of his whole nature,
his whole life.</p>
<p>And the night had revealed so much to him. His
horizon was bounded by storm-clouds threatening unconscious
lives. There they were banking, banking, low
down, so as to be almost invisible, and he knew that they
were only waiting a favoring breeze to mount up into the
heavens into one vast black mass. And then the breaking
of the storm. His calm brain was for once feverishly
at work. Those three must somehow be herded to shelter;
and he wondered how. His first play had proved
abortive, and now he wondered.</p>
<p>It was his intention to return to his hut for the night,
and he stood for a moment contemplating the dark village.
His busy thoughts decided for him that there was
nothing further to be done to-night. He told himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
that opportunity must be his guide in the riddle with
which he was confronted. He must rush nothing, and
he felt, somehow, that the opportunity would come. He
turned his eyes in the direction of his home, and as he
was about to move off he became aware of a footstep
crossing the market-place toward him. He waited. The
sound came from the direction of the saloon, and, as he
gazed that way, he saw the lights in the building go out
one by one. The person approaching was one of the
&ldquo;boys&rdquo; homeward bound.</p>
<p>He was half inclined to continue on his way and thus
avoid the probably drunken man, but something held
him, and a moment later he was glad when he saw the
figure of Jim Thorpe loom up. As they came into view
of each other Thorpe hesitated. Nor was it till he recognized
the huge outline of Peter that he came close up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Peter?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And Peter, listening, recognized that Jim was sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;just going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief pause after that, and both men were
thinking of the same thing. It was of the scene recently
enacted at the saloon. Peter was the one to break the
silence, and he ignored that which was in his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to the ranch on foot, and by way of Eve&rsquo;s
shack,&rdquo; he said in his gently humorous fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; responded Jim after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
Then he added with a conscious laugh, &ldquo;My &lsquo;plug&rsquo; is
back there at Rocket&rsquo;s tie-post, waiting, saddled.&rdquo; Then
he went on, becoming suddenly earnest. &ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;m
going for good. That is, I&rsquo;m going to quit McLagan&rsquo;s,
and get out. You see, I just wanted to have a look at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
shack&ndash;&ndash;for the last time. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t feel I can go without
that. She won&rsquo;t see me, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of final look round before you quit the&ndash;&ndash;sinking
ship, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet seriousness of the big man&rsquo;s tone sounded
keenly incisive in the stillness of the dark night. Jim
started, and hot blood mounted to his head. He had
been through so much that day that his nerves were still
on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; he demanded sharply. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
deserting a sinking ship&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s the sinking ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter pointed back at Eve&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Jim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drunk a lot to-day. Maybe my head&rsquo;s not clear.
Maybe&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s voice broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t need much clearness to understand, if you
know all the facts. I&rsquo;m not going to tell all I&rsquo;ve seen and
heard to-day either. But I&rsquo;m going to say a few words to
you, Jim, because I know you and like you, and because,
in spite of a few cranks in your head, you&rsquo;re a man. Just
now you&rsquo;re feeling reckless. Nothing much matters to
you. You&rsquo;re telling yourself that there&rsquo;s no particular
reason keeping straight. You have no interest, and when
the end comes you&rsquo;ll just shut out your lights and&ndash;&ndash;well,
there&rsquo;s nothing more to it. That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s my thoughts to do with quitting a sinking
ship?&rdquo; Jim asked a trifle impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny
you&rsquo;re likely right. I confess I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s much
incentive to&ndash;&ndash;well, to stick to a straight and narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
course. I&rsquo;ll certainly strike a gait of my own, and I don&rsquo;t
know that it&rsquo;ll be a slow one. It&rsquo;ll be honest though.
It&rsquo;ll be honest as far as the laws of man go. As for the
other laws, well, they&rsquo;re for my personal consideration as
far as my life is concerned. But this sinking ship. I&rsquo;d
like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love Eve?&rdquo; Peter abruptly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For G&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;s sake, what are you driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love her?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s demand would admit of no
avoidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s answer was deep down in his voice; his whole
soul was in his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t quit McLagan&rsquo;s, boy,&rdquo; Peter went on
earnestly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quit Barnriff. Jim, boy, you can&rsquo;t
have her, but you can help her to happiness by standing
by. I&rsquo;m going to stand by, too, for she&rsquo;s going to need
all the help we can both give her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I &lsquo;stand by&rsquo; with Will&ndash;&ndash;her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stand by <i>because</i> he&rsquo;s her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, can&rsquo;t you try to forget things where he&rsquo;s concerned?
Can&rsquo;t you try to forget that shooting match and
its result? Can&rsquo;t you? Think well. Can&rsquo;t you, outwardly
at least, make things up with him? It&rsquo;ll help to
keep him right, and help toward her happiness. Jim, I
ask you to do this for her sake, lad. I know what you
don&rsquo;t know, and I can&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s best I don&rsquo;t tell you.
It would do worse than no good. You say you love her
better than life. Well, boy, if Eve&rsquo;s to be made happy
we must help to keep Will right. He&rsquo;s got a devil
in him somewhere, and anything that goes awry with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
him sets that devil raging. Are you going to help Eve,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was some moments before any answer was forthcoming.
It was the old battle going on of the man against
himself. All that was human in Jim was tearing him in
one direction, while his better side&ndash;&ndash;his love for Eve&ndash;&ndash;was
pulling him in the opposite. He hated Will now. He
had given way in this direction completely. The man&rsquo;s
final outrage at the saloon had killed his last grain of feeling
for him. And now he was called upon to&ndash;&ndash;outwardly,
at least&ndash;&ndash;take up his old attitude toward him, a course
that would help Will to give the woman he had robbed
him of the happiness which he himself was not allowed
to bestow. Was ever so outrageous a demand upon a
man? He laughed bitterly, and aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Peter; it can&rsquo;t be done. I&rsquo;m no saint. I&rsquo;d
hate to be a saint. Will can go hang&ndash;&ndash;he can go to the
devil! And I say that because I love Eve better than all
else in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first sacrifice for that love you refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I refuse to give my friendship to Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love her, yet you will not help her to happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall never lack for happiness through me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter smiled in the darkness. A sigh of something
like satisfaction escaped him. He knew that, in spite of
the man&rsquo;s spoken refusal, his appeal was not entirely
unavailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t leave McLagan&rsquo;s then?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if Eve needs me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim became suddenly impatient.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For G&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;s sake, man, can&rsquo;t you speak out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Eve&rsquo;s sake, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the quiet rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Peter, I&rsquo;m going right on to the ranch now.
I&rsquo;ll remain. But, remember, I am no longer a friend of
Will&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;and never will be again. I&rsquo;ll never even pretend.
But if I can help Eve you can call on me. And&ndash;&ndash;I put
no limit on the hand I play. So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A WEDDING-DAY IN BARNRIFF</h3>
</div>
<p>If signs and omens meant anything at all, Eve Marsham
and Will Henderson were about to embark on a happy
and prosperous married life. So said the women of
Barnriff on the day fixed for the wedding. The feminine
heart of Barnriff was a superstitious organ. It loved
and hugged to itself its belief in forebodings and portents.
It never failed to find the promise of disaster or good-fortune
in the trivialities of its daily life. It was so
saturated with superstition that, on the morning of the
wedding, every woman in the place was on the lookout
for some recognized sign, and, finding none, probably
invented one.</p>
<p>And the excitement of it all. The single-minded,
wholesome delight in the thought of this wedding was as
refreshing as the crisp breezes of a first bright spring day.
To a woman they reveled in the thought. It was the
first wedding actually to take place in the village for over
seven years. Everybody marrying during that period had
elected to seek the consummation of their happiness elsewhere.
And as a consequence of this enthusiasm, there
was a surplus of help in getting the meeting-room
suitably clad for the occasion, and the preparations for the
&ldquo;sociable&rdquo; and dance which were to follow the ceremony.</p>
<p>Was there ever such a day in Barnriff? the women
asked each other. None of them remembered one. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
look at the day itself. True it was the height of summer;
but then who had not seen miserable weather in summer?
Look at the sun gleaming out of a perfect azure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Crombie, a florid dame of adequate size, if of
doubtful dignity to fill her position as spouse of Barnriff&rsquo;s
first citizen, dragged Mrs. Horsley, the lay preacher&rsquo;s wife,
through the door of the Mission Room, in which, with
the others, they were both working at the decorations, to
view the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it, my dear!&rdquo; she cried enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Was there ever a better omen for the poor dear? Not
a cloud <i>anywhere</i>. Not one. And it&rsquo;s deep blue, too;
none of your steel blues, or one of them fady blues running
to white. Say, ain&rsquo;t she lucky? Now, when
Crombie took me the heavens was just pouring. Everybody
said &lsquo;Tears&rsquo; prompt enough, and with reason.
That&rsquo;s what <i>they</i> said. But me and Crombie has never
shed a tear; no, not one. We&rsquo;ve just laffed our way
clear through to this day, we have. Well, I won&rsquo;t say
Crombie does a heap of laffing, but you&rsquo;ll take my
meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Carrie Horsley took it. She would have agreed
to anything so long as she could get a chance to empty
her reservoirs of enthusiasm into the Barnriff sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure are a lucky woman, Kate. Maybe the rain
wasn&rsquo;t an omen for you at all. Maybe it was for the folks
that <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> marry on that day. You see, it&rsquo;s easy reading
these things wrong. Now I never read omens wrong,
an&rsquo; the one I see this morning when I was bathin&rsquo; my
little Sammy boy was dead sure. You see, I got to bathe
him every morning for his spots, which is a heap better
now. And I&rsquo;m real glad, for Abe has got them spots on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
his mind. He guessed it was my blood out of order.
Said I needed sulphur in my tea. I kicked at that, an&rsquo;
said he&rsquo;d need to drink it, too. An&rsquo;, as he allowed he&rsquo;d
given up tea on account of his digestion, nothing come
of it. Of course I knew Sammy boy&rsquo;s spots was on&rsquo;y a
teething rash, but men is so queer; spechully if the child&rsquo;s
the first, and a boy. Now what&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the omen, dear?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Crombie, who
had all a woman&rsquo;s interest in babies, but was just then
ensnared in the net of superstition which held all Barnriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The omen? Oh, yes, I was coming to that. You
see, as I said I can read them, an&rsquo; this is one that never
fails, never. I&rsquo;ve <i>proved it</i>. When you prove an omen,
stick to it, I says&ndash;&ndash;and it pays. Now, this morning I set
my stockings on the wrong&ndash;&ndash;ahem&ndash;&ndash;legs, and not one,
but <i>both</i> of them was inside out. There&rsquo;s bad luck, as
you might say. And folks say that to escape it you must
keep &rsquo;em that ways all day. But I changed &rsquo;em! Yes,
mam, I changed &rsquo;em right in the face of misfortune, as
you might say. And why? you ask. Because I&rsquo;ve done
it before, and nothing come of it. And how did I change
&rsquo;em? you ask. Why, I stood to my knees in Sammy&rsquo;s
bath water, an&rsquo; then told Abe I&rsquo;d got my feet wet bathing
him. He says change &rsquo;em right away, Carrie, he
says, and, him being my man, why I just changed &rsquo;em,
seein&rsquo; I swore to obey him at the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very wise,&rdquo; observed Kate Crombie, sapiently. &ldquo;But
this omen for Eve&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. I was just coming to it. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t
much, as you might say, but I&rsquo;ve proved it before. It
come when I was ladling out Abe&rsquo;s cereal&ndash;&ndash;he always has
a cereal for breakfast. He says it eases his tubes when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
he preaches for the minister&ndash;&ndash;well, it come as I was ladling
out his cereal; it was oatmeal porridge, Scotch&ndash;&ndash;something
come over me, an&rsquo; my arm shook. It was
most unusual. Well, some of the cereal dropped right
on to the floor. Kate Crombie, that porridge dropped,
an&rsquo; when I looked there was a ring on the floor, a ring,
my dear. A wedding-ring of porridge, as you might say.
Did I call Abe&rsquo;s attention to it? I says, &lsquo;Abe,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;look!&rsquo; He looked. And not getting my meaning
proper, he says, &lsquo;Call the dog an&rsquo; let him lick it up!&rsquo;
With that I says, &lsquo;Abe, ain&rsquo;t you got eyes?&rsquo; And he
being slow in some things guessed he had. Then seeing
I was put about some, he says, &lsquo;Carrie,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;what
d&rsquo;ye mean?&rsquo; I see he was all of a quiver then, and feeling
kind of sorry for his ignorance I just shrugged at
him. &lsquo;Marriage bed!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;And,&rsquo; I says, feeling he
hadn&rsquo;t quite got it, &lsquo;in Barnriff.&rsquo; If that wasn&rsquo;t Eve&rsquo;s
good luck, why, I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you were bathing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&ndash;&ndash;that was another,&rdquo; Carrie replied hastily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate heard herself called away at that moment,
and hurried back into the hall. Her genius for administration
was the ruling power in the work of decoration,
and the enthusiasm of the helpers needed her controlling
hand to get the work done by noon, which was the time
fixed for the wedding.</p>
<p>But omen was the talk everywhere; it was impossible
to avoid it. Every soul in the place had her omen. Jane
Restless had a magpie. That very morning the bird had
stolen a leaden plummet belonging to Restless and
carried it to her cage, where she promptly set to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
work to hatch it out. And she fought when Zac went to
take it away. She made such a racket when it was gone
that Jane was sorry, and picked out a small chicken&rsquo;s
egg and put it into the bird&rsquo;s cage. &ldquo;And, my dears,&rdquo;
she concluded triumphantly, &ldquo;the langwidge that bird
used trying to cover up all that egg was simply awful.
What about that for luck? A magpie sittin&rsquo; on a wedding-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, perhaps, of the whole list of omens that happened
that morning, Pretty Wilkes, the baker&rsquo;s wife, held the
greatest interest for them all. She was a woman whose
austerity was renowned in the village, and Wilkes was
generally considered something of a hero. Her man had
won seventy dollars at poker the previous night, and had
got very drunk in the process. And being well aware of
the vagaries of his wife&rsquo;s sense of conjugal honor, had,
with a desperate drunken cunning, bestowed it over night
in the coal-box, well knowing that it was one of his many
domestic pleasures to have the honor of lighting the cook-stove
for his spouse every morning. &ldquo;And would you
believe it, girls?&rdquo; she cried ecstatically. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t
have been Eve&rsquo;s wedding-day, and I&rsquo;d got to bake cakes
for the sociable, and so had to be up at three this very
morning, while he was still dreaming he was a whiskey
trust or some other drunken delusion, I&rsquo;d sure never have
seen that wad nor touched five cents of it, he&rsquo;s that close.
Say, girls,&rdquo; she beamed, &ldquo;I never said a word to Jake for
getting soused, not a word. And I let him sleep right
on, an&rsquo; when he woke to light fires, and start baking, I
just give him a real elegant breakfast with cream in his
coffee, an&rsquo; asked him if he&rsquo;d like a bottle of rye for his
head. But say, I never see him shovel coal harder in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
my life than he did in that coal-box after breakfast. I&rsquo;d
like to gamble he&rsquo;s still shovelin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly was a gala day in Barnriff. The festivity
had even penetrated to the veins of Silas Rocket, and
possessed him of an atmosphere which &ldquo;let him in&rdquo; to the
extent of three rounds of drinks to the boys before eleven
o&rsquo;clock. The men for the most part took a long time
with their morning ablutions. But the effect was really
impressive and quite worth the extra trouble. The result
so lightened up the dingy village, that some of them, one
realized, had considerable pretensions to good looks. And
a further curious thing about this cleansing process was
that it affected their attitude toward each other. Their
talk became less familiar, a wave of something almost
like politeness set in. It suggested a clean starched shirt
just home from the laundry. They walked about without
their customary slouch, and each man radiated an atmosphere
of conscious rectitude that became almost importance.
Peter Blunt, talking to Doc Crombie, said he&rsquo;d
never seen so many precise creases in broadcloth since
he&rsquo;d lived in Barnriff.</p>
<p>There was no business to be done that day. Even
Smallbones was forced to keep his doors shut, though not
without audible protest. He asserted loudly that Congress
should be asked to pass a law preventing marriages taking
place in mercantile centres.</p>
<p>No one saw the bride and bridegroom that morning
except Peter Blunt and Annie Gay. Annie was acting
as Eve&rsquo;s maid for the occasion. She positively refused to
let the girl dress herself, and though she could not be her
bridesmaid, had expressed her deliberate intention of being
her strong support. She and Eve had worked together on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the wedding dress, which was of simple white lawn.
They had discussed together the trousseau, and made it.
They had talked and talked together over the whole thing
for two months, and she had handed Eve so much advice
out of her store of connubial wisdom, that she was not
going to give up her place now.</p>
<p>So it was arranged that Gay was to give Eve away, and
Annie was to be ready at the girl&rsquo;s elbow. That was how
Annie put it. And no one but herself knew quite what
she meant. However, it seemed to be perfectly satisfactory
to Eve, and their preparations continued, a whirl
of delight to them both.</p>
<p>Peter Blunt was Will&rsquo;s best man. And he found himself
left with nothing much to do but smile upon inquirers
after the bridegroom on the eventful day. His other
duties were wrested from him by anybody and everybody
in the place, which was a matter of considerable relief,
although he was willing enough. But there was one
other duty which could not be snatched from him, and it
was one that weighed seriously on his kindly mind. It
was the care of the wedding-ring. That, and the fear
lest he should not produce it at exactly the right moment,
gave him much cause for anxiety. Mrs. Gay had done
her duty by him. She had marked the place in the service
which he must study. And he had studied earnestly.
But as the hour of the wedding approached his nerves
tried him, and between fingering the ring in his waistcoat
pocket and repeating his &ldquo;cues&rdquo; over to himself, he
reached a painful condition of mental confusion which
bordered closely on a breakdown.</p>
<p>At half-past eleven the village was abustle with people
emerging from their houses. It was Gay who sighed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
he surveyed the throng. Not a soul but had a broad
smile on his or her face. And what with that, and the
liberal use of soap, such an atmosphere of health had
been arrived at that he pictured in his mind the final winding
up of his affairs as an undertaker.</p>
<p>Then came the saunter over to the Mission Room.
Everybody sauntered; it was as if they desired to prolong
the sensation. Besides, the women required to look
about them&ndash;&ndash;at other women&ndash;&ndash;and the men followed in
their wake, feeling that in all such affairs they acknowledged
the feminine leadership. They felt that somehow
they were there only on sufferance, a necessary evil to be
pushed into the background, like any other domestic
skeleton.</p>
<p>The Mission Room was packed, and the rustle of
starched skirts, and the cleanly laundry atmosphere that
pervaded the place was wonderfully wholesome. The
gathering suggested nothing so much as simple human
nature dipped well in the purifying soap-suds of sympathy,
rubbed out on the washing board of religious emotion,
and ironed and goffered to a proper sheen of wholesome
curiosity. They were assembled there to witness the
launching of a sister&rsquo;s bark upon the matrimonial
waters, and in each and every woman&rsquo;s mind there were
thoughts picturing themselves in a similar position. The
married women reflected on past scenes, while the maids
among them possibly contemplated the time when that
ceremonial would be performed with them as the central
interest.</p>
<p>The happiness was not all Eve&rsquo;s, it was probably
shared by the majority of the women present. She was
the object that conjured their minds from the dull
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
monotony of their daily routine to realms of happy fancy.
And the picture was drawn in a setting of Romance, with
Love well in the foreground, and the guardian angel of
Perfect Happiness hovering over all. No doubt somewhere
in the picture a man was skulking, but even in the
light of matrimonial experience this was not sufficient to
spoil the full enjoyment of those moments.</p>
<p>The bridegroom arrived. Yes, he was certainly good-looking
in his new suit from &ldquo;down East.&rdquo; Dressed as
he was he did not belong to Barnriff. He looked what
he had been brought up, of an altogether different class
to the folks gathered in the room.</p>
<p>One or two of the matrons shook their heads. They
did not altogether approve of him. He was well enough
known for a certain unsteadiness; then, too, there was a
boyishness about his look, an irresponsibility which was
not general among the hard features of the men they
knew. Most of these thought that Eve was rather throwing
herself away. They all believed that she would have
done far better to have chosen Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>Then came the bride, and necks craned and skirts rustled,
and audible whisperings were in the air. Annie
Gay, following behind, heard and saw, and a thrill of delight
brought tears to her sympathetic eyes. She knew
how pretty Eve was. Had she not dressed her? Had
she not feasted her eyes on her all the morning? Had
she not been a prey to a good honest feminine envy?</p>
<p>And Eve&rsquo;s dress was almost as pretty as herself. There
were just a few touches of a delicate pink on the white
lawn to match her own warmth of coloring. Her gentle
eyes were lowered modestly as she walked through the
crowd, but if their pretty brown was hidden from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
public gaze her wealth of rich, warm hair was not, and
Eve&rsquo;s hair was the delight and envy of every woman in
Barnriff. Yes, they were all very, very pleased with her,
particularly as she, being a dressmaker with all sorts of
possibilities in the way of a wedding-dress within her
reach, had elected to wear a dress which any one of them
could have afforded, any one of them had possibly worn
in her time.</p>
<p>The ceremony proceeded with due solemnity. The
minister was all sympathetic unction, and was further a
perfect model of dignified patience when Peter Blunt
finally scrambled the ring into the bridegroom&rsquo;s hand
several lines later than was his &ldquo;cue,&rdquo; but in time to save
himself from utter disgrace. And the end came emotionally,
as was only to be expected in such a community.
Kate Crombie, being leader of the village society,
started it. She promptly laid her head on Jake Wilkes&rsquo;
shoulder and sniveled. Nor was it until he turned his
head and fumbled out awkward words of consolation to
her, that the reek of stale rye warned her of her mistake,
and she promptly came to and looked for her husband
to finish it out on.</p>
<p>Annie Gay wept happy tears, and laughed and cried
joyously. Jane Restless borrowed her man&rsquo;s bandana
and blew her nose like a steam siren, declaring that the
heat always gave her catarrh. Carrie Horsley guessed
she&rsquo;d never seen so pretty a bride so elegantly dressed,
and wept down the front of Eve&rsquo;s spotless lawn the moment
she got near enough. Mrs. Rust sniffed audibly, and
hoped she would be happy, but warned her strongly against
the tribulations of an ever-increasing family, and finally
flopped heavily into a chair calling loudly for brandy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>It was, in Doc Crombie&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the old hens who
got emotions.&rdquo; It was only the younger women, the
spinsters, who laughed and flirted with the men, giggling
hysterically at the sallies ever dear at a matrimonial function
which flew from lip to lip. But then, as Pretty
Wilkes told her particular crony Mrs. Rust later on at the
sociable&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same with us, my dear,&rdquo; she said feelingly.
&ldquo;Speaking personal, before I was married, I&rsquo;d got the
notion, foolish-like, that every man had kind o&rsquo; got loose
out of heaven, an&rsquo; we women orter set up a gilded cage
around &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; feed &rsquo;em cookies, an&rsquo; any other elegant
fancy truck we could get our idiot hands on. They was
a sort of idol to be bowed an&rsquo; scraped to. They was the
rulers of our destiny, the lords of the earth. But now I&rsquo;m
of the opinion that the best man among &rsquo;em couldn&rsquo;t run
a low down hog ranch without disgracin&rsquo; hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not till after the ceremony was over, and before
the &ldquo;sociable,&rdquo; which was to precede the bride and
bridegroom&rsquo;s departure for Will&rsquo;s shack up in the hills,
where she was to spend a fortnight&rsquo;s honeymoon before
returning to Barnriff to take up again the work of her
dressmaking business, that Peter Blunt had time to think
of other things. He was not required in the ordering of
the &ldquo;sociable.&rdquo; The women would look to that.</p>
<p>Before he left the Mission Room, to return to his hut
to see that his preparations were complete for Elia to
take up his abode with him for the next fortnight&ndash;&ndash;he
had finally obtained Eve&rsquo;s consent to this arrangement&ndash;&ndash;he
scanned the faces of the assembled crowd closely. He
had seen nothing of Jim Thorpe during the last two
months, except on the rare occasions when the foreman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
of the &ldquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rdquo; had visited the saloon. And at these
times neither had mentioned Eve&rsquo;s wedding. Now he
was anxious to find out if Jim had been amongst the
spectators at the wedding, a matter which to his mind
was of some importance. It was impossible to ascertain
from where he stood, and finally he made his way to the
bottom of the hall where the door had been opened and
people were beginning to move out. As he reached the
back row benches he bumped into the burly Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen Thorpe?&rdquo; he inquired quickly.</p>
<p>Gay pointed through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Say, let&rsquo;s get a drink. This
dogone marryin&rsquo; racket&rsquo;s calc&rsquo;lated to set a camel dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter wanted Thorpe and refused the man&rsquo;s invitation.
He was glad Jim had come in for the wedding,
and hurried out in pursuit. He caught his man in the
act of mounting his broncho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jim!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he hastened up.</p>
<p>Nor did he continue as the ranchman turned and faced
him. He had never seen quite such an expression on
Jim&rsquo;s face before. The dark eyes were fiercely alight,
the clean-cut brows were drawn together in an expression
that might have indicated either pain or rage. His jaws
were hard set. And the pallor of his skin was plainly
visible through the rich tanning of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monosyllable was jerked out through clenched
teeth, and had something of defiance in it. Peter fumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came in,&rdquo; he said, a little helplessly.</p>
<p>The reply he received was a laugh so harsh, so bitter,
that the other was startled. It was the laugh of a beaten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
man who strives vainly to hide his hurt. It was an expression
of tense nerves, and told of the agony of a heart
laboring under its insufferable burden. It was the sign
of a man driven to the extremity of endurance, telling,
only too surely, of the thousand and one dangers
threatening him. Peter understood, and his own manner
steadied into that calm strength which was so much the
man&rsquo;s real personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going over to my shack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
best walk your horse over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting back right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t press you,&rdquo; Peter went on, his mild
eyes glancing swiftly at the door of the Mission Room,
where the villagers were scrambling out with a great
chattering and bustle. &ldquo;Just bring your plug out of the
crowd, Jim,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a word before you
go.&rdquo; Without waiting for his friend&rsquo;s consent, he took
the horse&rsquo;s bridle and led the animal on one side. And,
oddly enough, his direction was toward the Mission
Room door. Jim submitted without much patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded, as they halted within
three yards of the door. &ldquo;Guess I haven&rsquo;t a heap of time.
McLagan&rsquo;s busy breaking horses, and he told me to get
right out after the&ndash;&ndash;ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; nodded Peter, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you long. I&rsquo;d
heard there was breaking on the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s just it.
Now, I&rsquo;m looking for a couple of plugs. One for saddle,
and the other to carry a pack. You see, I&rsquo;ve struck
color in a curious place, and it promises good. But it&rsquo;s
away off, near twenty miles in the foot-hills. It&rsquo;s an outcrop
I&rsquo;ve been tracing for quite a while, and if my calculations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
are right, the reef comes right along down here
through Barnriff. You see, I&rsquo;ve been working on those
old Indian stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and his quick eyes saw that the crowd was
lining the doorway waiting for Eve and her husband to
come out. Jim was interested in his tale in spite of himself,
yet fidgeting to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I need two horses to carry myself and camp
outfit. And&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Say, here&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; he cried, his large
hand suddenly gripping Jim&rsquo;s arm and detaining him.
The ranchman shook him off and made to mount his
horse. But Peter had no idea of letting him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said in a tone for the man&rsquo;s ear alone, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t go yet. You can&rsquo;t push a horse through the crowd
till she&rsquo;s gone. Say, boy&ndash;&ndash;you can&rsquo;t go. Here she is.
Just look at her. Look at her sweet, smiling eyes. Jim,
look. That gal&rsquo;s real happy&ndash;&ndash;now. Jim, there ain&rsquo;t
much happiness in this world. We&rsquo;re all chasing it. You
and me, too&ndash;&ndash;and we don&rsquo;t often find it. Say, boy, you
don&rsquo;t grudge her her bit, do you? You&rsquo;d rather see her
happy, if it ain&rsquo;t with you, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Ah, look at
those eyes. She&rsquo;s seen us, you and me. That&rsquo;s me
being such a lumbering feller. And she&rsquo;s coming over to
us; Will, too.&rdquo; His grip on the man&rsquo;s arm tightened,
and his voice dropped to a low whisper. &ldquo;Jim, you
can&rsquo;t go, now. You&rsquo;ve got to speak to her. You&rsquo;re a
man, a real live man; get a grip on that&ndash;&ndash;and don&rsquo;t
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he released his hold, and Eve and Will came up.
Eve&rsquo;s radiant eyes smiled on him, but passed at once to
Jim. And she left Will&rsquo;s arm to move nearer to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Peter&rsquo;s eyes were on the darkening brows of her husband,
and the moment Eve&rsquo;s hand slipped from his arm, he
gave the latter no choice but to speak to him. He began
at once, and with all his resource held him talking, while
Eve demanded Jim&rsquo;s congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you since&ndash;&ndash;since&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Eve.&rdquo; Then the man cleared his throat. It was
parching, and he felt that words were impossible. What
trick was this Peter had played on him? He longed to
flee, yet in the face of all that crowd he could not. He
knew he must smile, and with all the power of his body
he set himself to the task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we&rsquo;ve been up to our necks in work. I&ndash;&ndash;I
just snatched the morning to see you&ndash;&ndash;you married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no congratulations? Oh, Jim! And I&rsquo;ve always
looked on you and Peter as&ndash;&ndash;as my best friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every word she uttered struck home through the worn
armor of his restraint. He longed madly to seize this
woman in his arms and tear her from the side of his rival.
The madness of his love cried out to him, and sent the
blood surging to his brain. But he fought&ndash;&ndash;fought himself
with almost demoniac fury, and won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, with an intensity that must have struck
her had she not been so exalted by her own emotions,
&ldquo;I wish you the greatest happiness that ever fell to a
woman&rsquo;s lot. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, this
world&rsquo;ll give you everything you most wish for. And,
further, you are right to reckon Peter and me your best
friends. As a favor, I ask you that whenever our
friendship can be of service to you you&rsquo;ll call upon it.
Good-bye and&ndash;&ndash;bless you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had his reward, if reward it could be called. Eve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
thrust out one white-gloved hand and seized his, squeezing
it with a gentle pressure that set his blood throbbing
through his veins afresh.</p>
<p>Then the agony passed, and left him cold. The warm
hand was withdrawn, and the girl turned back to her husband.
Peter relinquished his ward. The big man&rsquo;s end
had been accomplished. As husband and wife walked
away, and the crowd dispersed, he turned to Jim, who
stood gazing straight in front of him. He looked into his
face, and the smile in his eyes disappeared. The expression
of Jim&rsquo;s face had changed, and where before storm had
raged in every pulse, now there was a growing peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;about those horses&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you won&rsquo;t need them now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorpe looked up into the grizzled face with a half
ironical smile, but without displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, you had me beat from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ve won to-day, boy. Guess you&rsquo;ve beat
the devil in you to a hash. Yes; I need those horses, an&rsquo;
you can get &rsquo;em for me from McLagan.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE QUEST OF PETER BLUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>The crisp air of summer early morning, so fragrant, so
invigorating, eddied across the plains, wafting new life to
the lungs, and increased vigor to jaded muscles. The sun
was lifting above the horizon, bringing with it that expansion
to the mind which only those whose lives are passed
in the open, and whose waking hours are such as Nature
intended, may know.</p>
<p>The rustling grass, long, lean at the waving tops, but
rich and succulent in its undergrowth, spoke of awakening
life, obeying that law which man, in his superiority,
sets aside to suit his own artificial pleasures. The sparkling
morning haze shrouding the foot-hills was lifting,
yielding a vision of natural beauty unsurpassed at any
other time of the day. The earth was good&ndash;&ndash;it was
clean, wholesome, purified by the long restful hours of
night, and ready to yield, as ever, those benefits to animal
life which Nature so generously showers upon an ungrateful
world.</p>
<p>Peter Blunt straightened up from his camp-fire which
he had just set going. He stretched his great frame and
drank in the nectar of the air in deep gulps. The impish
figure of Elia sat on a box to windward of the fire, watching
his companion with calm eyes. He was enjoying
himself as he had rarely ever enjoyed himself. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
free from the trammels of his sister&rsquo;s loving, guiding hand&ndash;&ndash;trammels
which were ever irksome to him, and
which, somewhere inside him, he despised as a bondage
to which his sex had no right to submit. He was with
his friend Peter, helping him in his never-ending quest
for gold. Hunting for gold. It sounded good in the
boy&rsquo;s ears. Gold. Everybody dreamed of gold; everybody
sought it&ndash;&ndash;even his sister. But this&ndash;&ndash;this was a
new life.</p>
<p>There were Peter&rsquo;s tools, there was their camp, there
was the work in process. There was his own little A
tent, which Peter insisted that he should sleep in, while,
for himself, he required only the starry sky as a roofing,
and good thick blankets, to prevent the heat going out
of his body while he slept. Yes; the boy was happy in
his own curious way. He was living on &ldquo;sow-belly&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hardtack,&rdquo; and extras in the way of &ldquo;canned truck,&rdquo;
and none of the good things which his sister had ever
made for him had tasted half so sweet as the rough cooking
of this wholesome food by Peter. Something like
happiness was his just now; but he regretted that it
could only last until his sister returned to Barnriff. The
boy&rsquo;s interest in the coming day&rsquo;s work now inspired
his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go on with this sinking?&rdquo; he inquired; and there
was a boyish pride in the use of the plural.</p>
<p>Peter nodded. His eyes were watching the fire, to see
that it played no trick on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, laddie,&rdquo; he said, in his kindly way. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got a bully prospect here. We&rsquo;ll see it through after
we&rsquo;ve had breakfast. Sleepy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia returned him an unsmiling negative. Smiling was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
apparently unnatural to him. The lack of it and the lack
of expression in his eyes, except when stirred by terror,
showed something of the warp of his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t damp, or&ndash;&ndash;or anything? There&rsquo;s a heap
of dew around.&rdquo; The man was throwing strips of &ldquo;sow-belly&rdquo;
into the pan, and the coffee water was already set
upon the flaming wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t to worry &rsquo;bout them things for me, Peter,&rdquo;
Elia declared peevishly. &ldquo;Wimmin folks are like that,
an&rsquo; it sure makes me sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other laughed good-naturedly as he took a couple
of handfuls of the &ldquo;hardtack&rdquo; out of a sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be a man only they won&rsquo;t let you, eh? You&rsquo;ve
the grit, laddie, there&rsquo;s no denying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy felt pleased. Peter understood him. He liked
Peter, only sometimes he wished the man wasn&rsquo;t so big
and strong. Why wasn&rsquo;t he hump-backed with a bent
neck and a &ldquo;game&rdquo; leg? Why wasn&rsquo;t he afraid of
things? Then he never remembered seeing Peter hurt
anything, and he loved to hurt. He felt as if he&rsquo;d like to
thrust a burning brand on Peter&rsquo;s hand while he was
cooking, and see if he was afraid of the hurt, the same as
he would be. Then his mind came back to things of the
moment. This gold prospecting interested him more
than anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are we from Barnriff?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty odd miles west. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was kind o&rsquo; wonderin&rsquo;. Seems we&rsquo;ve been headin&rsquo;
clear thro&rsquo; fer Barnriff since we started from way back
there on the head waters. We sunk nine holes, hain&rsquo;t
we? Say, if we keep right on we&rsquo;ll hit Barnriff on this
line?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s blue eyes were watching the boy&rsquo;s
face interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found the color o&rsquo; gold, an&rsquo; the ledge o&rsquo; quartz
in each o&rsquo; them holes, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we keep on, an&rsquo; we find right along, we&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to find some around Barnriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, laddie,&rdquo; Peter replied, approving his obvious
reasoning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on those old Indian yarns, and,
according to them, Barnriff must be set right on a mighty
rich gold mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calm eyes of the boy brightened. Barnriff on a
gold mine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes dropped before the other&rsquo;s inquiring gaze.
That was the question always before him, but it did not
apply to material gold. And when he should find it,
what then? Simply his quest would have closed at
another chapter. His work for the moment would be
finished; and he would once more have to set out on a
fresh quest to appease his restless soul. He shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found it yet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when you do?&rdquo; the boy persisted.</p>
<p>Peter handed him his plate and his coffee, and sat down
to his own breakfast. But the boy insisted on an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, laddie, it&rsquo;s kind of tough answering that. I
can&rsquo;t rightly tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a gold mine. Gee! You&rsquo;ll be like a Noo York
millionaire, with dollars an&rsquo; dollars to blow in at the
saloon.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>Again Peter shook his head. His face seemed suddenly
to have grown old. His eyes seemed to lack their wonted
lustre. He sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the dollars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got dollars
enough; so many that I hate &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia gaped at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got dollars in heaps?&rdquo; he almost gasped. &ldquo;Then
why are you lookin&rsquo; for more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter buried his face in a large pannikin of coffee, and
when it emerged the questioning eyes were still upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks guess you&rsquo;re cranked on gold, an&rsquo; need it bad,&rdquo;
the puzzled boy went on. &ldquo;They reckon you&rsquo;re foolish,
too, allus lookin&rsquo; around where you don&rsquo;t need, &rsquo;cause
there ain&rsquo;t any there. I&rsquo;ve heerd fellers say you&rsquo;re
crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed right out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, lighting his pipe.</p>
<p>But Elia shook his head shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t crazy. I&rsquo;d sure know it. Same as I know
when a feller&rsquo;s bad&ndash;&ndash;like Will Henderson. But say,
Peter,&rdquo; he went on persuasively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be real glad fer you
to tell me &rsquo;bout that gold. What you&rsquo;d do, an&rsquo; why? I&rsquo;m
real quick understanding things. It kind o&rsquo; seems to me
you&rsquo;re good. You don&rsquo;t never scare me like most folks.
I can&rsquo;t see right why&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, laddie&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Peter leaned his head back on his two
locked hands, and propped himself against the pack
saddle&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry your head with those things.
But I&rsquo;ll tell you something, if you&rsquo;re quick understanding.
Maybe, if other folks heard it&ndash;&ndash;grown folks&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;d sure
say I was crazy. But you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m not crazy, only&ndash;&ndash;only
maybe tired of things a bit. It&rsquo;s not gold I&rsquo;m looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
for&ndash;&ndash;that is, in a way. I&rsquo;m looking for something
that all the gold in the world can&rsquo;t buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone became reflective. He was talking to the
boy, but his thoughts seemed suddenly to have drifted
miles away, lost in a contemplation of something which
belonged to the soul in him alone. He was like a man
who sees a picture in his mind which absorbs his whole
attention, and drifts him into channels of thought which
belong to his solitary moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for it day in day out, weeks and years.
Sometimes I think I find it, and then it&rsquo;s gone again.
Sometimes I think it don&rsquo;t exist; then again I&rsquo;m sure it
does. Yes, there&rsquo;ve been moments when I know I&rsquo;ve
found it, but it gets out of my hand so quick I can&rsquo;t
rightly believe I&rsquo;ve ever had it. I go on looking, on and
on, and I&rsquo;ll go on to my dying day, I s&rsquo;pose. Other folks
are doing much the same, I guess, but they don&rsquo;t know
they&rsquo;re doing it, and they&rsquo;re the luckier for it. What&rsquo;s
the use, anyway&ndash;&ndash;and yet, I s&rsquo;pose, we must all work out
our little share in the scheme of things. Seems to me
we&rsquo;ve all got our little &lsquo;piece&rsquo; to say, all got our little bit
to do. And we&rsquo;ve just got to go on doing it to the end.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard, sometimes it&rsquo;s so mighty easy it sets
you wondering. Ah, psha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he roused out of his mood, and addressed himself
more definitely to the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, laddie, I don&rsquo;t belong to this country. But
I stay right here till I&rsquo;ve searched all I know, and so done
my &lsquo;piece.&rsquo; Then I&rsquo;ll up stakes and move on. You see,
it&rsquo;s no use going back where I belong, because what I&rsquo;m
looking for don&rsquo;t exist there. Maybe I&rsquo;ll never find what
I&rsquo;m looking for&ndash;&ndash;that is to keep and hold it. Maybe, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
I say, I&rsquo;ll get it in driblets, and it&rsquo;ll fly away again. It
don&rsquo;t much matter. Meanwhile I find gold&ndash;&ndash;in those
places folks don&rsquo;t guess it&rsquo;s any use looking. Do you get
my meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quizzical smile that accompanied his final question
was very gentle, and revealed something of the soul of the
man.</p>
<p>Elia didn&rsquo;t answer for some moments. He was trying
to straighten out the threads of light which his twisted
mind perceived. Finally he shook his head. And when
he spoke his words showed only too plainly how little he
was interested in the other&rsquo;s meaning, and how much his
cupidity was stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that gold&ndash;&ndash;in Barnriff? When you&rsquo;ve found
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed to think that he had expected the boy
to understand him. How could he&ndash;&ndash;at his age?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you, laddie&ndash;&ndash;all of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia&rsquo;s cold eyes lit with sudden greed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d best say nothing to the folks,&rdquo; Peter added
slyly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em know we&rsquo;re looking for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; cried the boy quickly, with a cunning painful
to behold. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d steal it. Will Henderson would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter thought for a moment, and relit his pipe, which
had gone out while he was talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Will, laddie,&rdquo; he said presently, and so
blundered into the midst of the boy&rsquo;s greedy reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any joy that the thought of the promised gold might
have given him suddenly died out of the dwarf&rsquo;s vindictive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
heart, and in its place was a raging storm of
hatred. Such savage passion was his dominating feature.
At the best there was little that was gentle in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate him because of that night&ndash;&ndash;about the
chickens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer was forthcoming. Peter waited, and
then went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the eyes of the boy were fixed upon the now
smouldering fire, nor could the other draw them. So he
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&rsquo;s your sister&rsquo;s husband now. Sort of your&ndash;&ndash;brother.
Your sister&rsquo;s been desperate good to you.
You&rsquo;ve had everything she could give you, and mind,
she&rsquo;s had to work for it&ndash;&ndash;hard. She loves you so bad,
she&rsquo;d hate to see you hurt your little finger&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s mighty
good to you. Gee, I wish I had such a sister. Well,
now she&rsquo;s got a husband, and she loves him bad, too. I
was wondering if you&rsquo;d ever thought how bad she&rsquo;d feel
if she knew you two were at loggerheads? You&rsquo;ve
never thought, have you? Say, laddie, it would break
her up the back. It would surely. She&rsquo;d feel she&rsquo;d done
you a harm&ndash;&ndash;and that in itself is sufficient&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;d
feel she was upsetting Will. And between the two she&rsquo;d
be most unhappy. Say, can&rsquo;t you like him? Can&rsquo;t you
make up your mind to get on with him right when he
comes back? Can&rsquo;t you, laddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes suddenly lifted from the fire, and the
storm was still in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo; he snarled like a fierce beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;real sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go fer to be sorry,&rdquo; cried the boy, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
that strange quickening of all that was evil in him. &ldquo;I
tell you Will&rsquo;s bad. He&rsquo;s bad, an&rsquo; he sure don&rsquo;t need to
be, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s in him to be good. He ain&rsquo;t like me, I
guess. I&rsquo;m bad &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m made bad. I don&rsquo;t never
think good. I can&rsquo;t. I hate&ndash;&ndash;hate&ndash;&ndash;allus hate. That&rsquo;s
how I&rsquo;m made, see? Will ain&rsquo;t like that. He&rsquo;s made
good, but he&rsquo;s bad because he&rsquo;d rather be bad. He&rsquo;s
married my sister because she&rsquo;s a fool, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t see where
Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s a better man. Jim Thorpe wanted to
marry her. He never said, but I can see. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
have married him, on&rsquo;y fer Will comin&rsquo; along. She was
kind o&rsquo; struck on Jim like, an&rsquo; then Will butts in, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
younger, an&rsquo; better lookin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; so she marries him. An&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;
I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your sister? What&rsquo;s poor Eve going to do with
you always hating Will? She&rsquo;ll get no happiness, laddie,
and you&rsquo;d rather see her happy. Say, if you can&rsquo;t
help hating Will, sure you can hide it. You needn&rsquo;t to
run foul of him. You go your way, and he can go his.
Do you know I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll try and do right by
you, because of Eve&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Peter, you&rsquo;re foolish.&rdquo; The boy had calmed,
and now spoke with a shrewd decision that was curiously
convincing. &ldquo;Will&rsquo;ll go his way, and Eve won&rsquo;t figger
wuth a cent with him. I know. Eve&rsquo;ll jest have to git
her toes right on the mark, same as me. He&rsquo;s a devil,
and I know. Will&rsquo;ll make Eve hate herself, same as
he&rsquo;ll make me. Say, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you this, Eve&rsquo;ll hev to
work for him as well as me. I know. I can see. You
can&rsquo;t tell me of Will, nor of nobody that&rsquo;s bad&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;cause I
ken see into &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m bad, an&rsquo; I ken see into folks who
&rsquo;re bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>There was no argument against such an attitude as the
boy took. Besides, Peter began to understand. Here
was an unique study in psychology. The boy either
fancied he possessed&ndash;&ndash;or did possess&ndash;&ndash;such unusual
powers of observation that they almost amounted to the
prophetic, where that which was bad was concerned. He
saw Will in a light in which no one else saw him,
although already he, Peter, and Jim had witnessed unpleasant
dashes of that side of the man&rsquo;s character which
Elia seemed to read like an open book. However, he
could not abandon his task yet, but he changed his
tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, laddie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was thinking
of poor Eve. I was wondering if you wouldn&rsquo;t like
to try and make her happy, seeing she&rsquo;s always been so
good to you. I do believe you&rsquo;d rather she was happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded his head, and an impish light crept
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to try and make her&ndash;&ndash;happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was smiling with simple eager hope. The impish
light deepened in the boy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll do what I ken. When
Will treats me fair I&rsquo;ll treat him fair. I can&rsquo;t do a heap
of work, seein&rsquo; I&rsquo;m as I am, but if he wants me to do
things I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;if he treats me fair. I&rsquo;ll do what I
ken, but I hate him. Maybe you&rsquo;re guessin&rsquo; that&rsquo;ll be
makin&rsquo; things fair for Eve. You best guess agin.&rdquo; Then
the impish light left his eyes, and they became quite
serious again. &ldquo;Say, tell me some more &rsquo;bout that
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough, laddie,&rdquo; he said, pleased with the result
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
of his first essay on behalf of peace between Elia and
Will. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get that gold when we find it,
sure, so come right along and let&rsquo;s get to work&ndash;&ndash;and
find it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AFTER ONE YEAR</h3>
</div>
<p>Scandal was rampant in Barnriff. But it was not of
an open nature. That is to say, it was scandal that
passed surreptitiously from lip to lip, and was rarely
spoken where more than two people foregathered. For
small as Barnriff was, ignorant as were the majority of its
people, scandal was generally tabooed, and it was only in
bad cases where it was allowed to riot.</p>
<p>The reason of this restraint was simple enough. It
was not that the people of the village were any different
to those of other small places. They loved gossip as
dearly as anybody else&ndash;&ndash;when to gossip was safe. But
years ago Barnriff had learned that gossip was not always
safe in its midst.</p>
<p>The fact was that the peace laws of the place were
largely enforced by a process which might be called the
&ldquo;survival of the strong.&rdquo; There were no duly authorized
peace officers, and the process had evolved out of this
condition of things. Quarrels and bloodshed were by no
means frequent in the village, rather the reverse, and this
was due to the regulations governing peace.</p>
<p>If two men quarreled it was on the full understanding
of the possible and probable consequences; namely, a
brief and effective life and death struggle, followed by a
sudden and immediate departure from the fold of the
survivor. Hence, scandal was held in close check, and
traveled slowly, with the slow twistings and windings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
of a venemous snake. But for this very reason it was the
more deadly, and was the more surely based upon undeniable
fact. The place was just now a-simmer with suppressed
scandal.</p>
<p>And its object. It was only a year since Eve and
Will Henderson&rsquo;s marriage. A sufficiently right and
proper affair, said public opinion. There were of course
protestors. Many of the women had expected Eve to
marry Jim Thorpe. But then they were of the more
mature section of the population, those whose own
marriages had taught them worldly wisdom, and blotted
out the early romance of their youths. It had been a love
match, a match where youth runs riot, and the madness
of it sweeps its victims along upon its hot tide. Now the
tide was cooling, some said it was already cold.</p>
<p>After their brief honeymoon the young people had
returned to the village. The understanding was that Eve
should again take up her business, while Will continued
his season up in the hills, hunting with his traps and gun.
He was to visit Barnriff at intervals during the season,
and finally return and stay with Eve during the months
when the furs he might take would be unfit for the
market. This was the understanding, and in theory it
was good, and might well have been carried out satisfactorily.
All went passably well until the close of the
fur season.</p>
<p>Eve returned to the village a bright and happy woman.
She took up her business again, and, perhaps, the novelty
of her married state was the reason that at first her trade
increased. Then came Will&rsquo;s visits. At first they were
infrequent, with the arranged-for laps of time between
them. But gradually they became more frequent and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
their duration longer. The women wagged their heads.
&ldquo;He is so deeply in love, he can&rsquo;t stay away,&rdquo; they said.
And they smiled approval, for they were women, and
women can never look on unmoved at the sight of a
happy love match. But against this the men shrugged
their shoulders. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wastin&rsquo; a heap o&rsquo; time,&rdquo; they
said; &ldquo;pelts needs chasin&rsquo; some, an&rsquo; y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t chase pelts
an&rsquo; make love to your own wife or any one else&rsquo;s, for that
matter.&rdquo; And this was their way of expressing a kindly
interest.</p>
<p>The men were right and the women were wrong.
Will did more than waste time. He literally pitched it
away. He prolonged his stays in the village beyond all
reason, and as Eve, dutifully engaged upon her business,
could not give him any of her working hours, he was
forced to seek his pleasures elsewhere. That elsewhere,
in a man prone to drink, of necessity became the saloon.
And the saloon meant gambling, gambling meant money.
Sometimes he won a little, but more often he lost.</p>
<p>Being a reckless player, fired by the false stimulation
of Rocket&rsquo;s bad whiskey, he began to plunge to recoup
himself, and, as ever happens in such circumstances, he
got deeper into the mire. At first these heavy losses had
a salutary effect upon him, and he would &ldquo;hit the trail&rdquo;
for the hills, and once more ply his trade with a feverish
zest.</p>
<p>This sort of thing went on until the close of his fur
season. Then he made up his bales of pelts, and, to his
horror, discovered that his year&rsquo;s &ldquo;catch&rdquo; was reduced
by over fifty per cent., while, in place of a wad of good
United States currency in his hip pocket, he had floated
a perfect fleet of I. O. U.&rsquo;s, each in itself for a comparatively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
small amount, but collectively a total of no inconsiderable
magnitude. And each I. O. U. was dated for
payment immediately after he had marketed his pelts.</p>
<p>This stress, and the life he had been living in Barnriff,
caused his mercurial temper to suffer. And as his nature
soured, so all that was worst in him began to rise to the
surface. He did not blame himself. Did ever one hear
of a man blaming himself when things went wrong? No.
He blamed the fur season. The hills were getting played
out. The furs were traveling north, and, in consequence
were scarce. Besides, how could he be in Barnriff and
the hills at the same time? The position was absurd.
Eve must join him and give up her business, and they
must make their home up in the hills where she could
learn to trap. Or they must live in Barnriff and he must
find fresh employment.</p>
<p>Yes, he would certainly find out how Eve&rsquo;s business
was prospering. If she had shown a better turnover than
he, perhaps it would be as well for him to go into Barnriff
for good. The idea rather pleased him. Nor could he
see any drawback to it except those confounded I. O. U.&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The next news that Barnriff had was that Will and
Eve were settled for good in the village, and that he had
no intention of returning to the hills. Barnriff&rsquo;s comment
was mixed. The women said, &ldquo;Poor dears, they can&rsquo;t
live apart.&rdquo; Again the men disagreed. Their charity
was less kind, especially amongst those who had yet to
collect the payment of their I. O. U.&rsquo;s. They said with
sarcastic smile, &ldquo;Wants to live on his woman, and play
&lsquo;draw.&rsquo;&rdquo;  And time soon showed them to be somewhere
near the mark.</p>
<p>Will sold his furs, paid his debts, sighed his relief, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
settled down to a life in Barnriff. A month later he found
to his profound chagrin that the small margin of dollars
left over after paying off his I. O. U.&rsquo;s had vanished, and
a fresh crop of paper was beginning to circulate. Whiskey
and &ldquo;draw&rdquo; had got into his blood, and all unconsciously
he found himself pledged to it.</p>
<p>It was during this time that scandal definitely laid its
clutch upon the village. But it was not until later that
its forked tongue grew vicious. It was at the time that
word got round the village that there was trouble in Eve&rsquo;s
little home that the caldron began to seethe. No one knew
how it got round; yet it surely did. Scandal said that
Eve and Will quarreled, that they quarreled violently,
that Will had struck her, that money was the bottom of
the trouble, that Will had none to meet his gambling
debts, and that Eve, who had been steadily supplying
him out of her slender purse, had at last refused to do so
any more.</p>
<p>It went on to say that Will was a drunken sot, that his
methods at cards were not above suspicion, and that
altogether he was rapidly becoming an undesirable.</p>
<p>Peter Blunt heard the scandal; he had watched things
himself very closely. Jim Thorpe heard, but, curiously
enough, rumor about these two did not seem to reach
the &ldquo;AZ&rdquo; ranch easily.</p>
<p>However, what did reach Jim infuriated him almost
beyond words. It was this last rumor that sent him riding
furiously into the village late one night, and drew him
up at Peter Blunt&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>He found the gold seeker reading a well-known history
of the Peruvian Aztecs, but without hesitation broke in
upon his studies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear, Peter?&rdquo; he demanded, without
any preamble. &ldquo;I mean about the&ndash;&ndash;the Hendersons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dark eyes were fierce. His clean-cut features were
set and angry. But these signs didn&rsquo;t seem to hurry Peter&rsquo;s
answer. He laid his book aside and folded his hands behind
his head, while he searched the other&rsquo;s face with his
calm blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got it out on the ranch,&rdquo; Jim went on.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s knocking her about&ndash;&ndash;they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;ve come in. What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man&rsquo;s words had a calming effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Jim went on, with a
sudden change of manner that became almost pleading.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful. I can&rsquo;t bear to think of Eve suffering. Is
it, as they say, money? Has he&ndash;&ndash;gone to the dogs with
drink and gambling? Peter,&rdquo; he said, with sudden sternness,
his feelings once more getting the better of him,
&ldquo;I feel like killing him if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other&rsquo;s face was cold, and he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to talk this scandal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
no right to feel like that&ndash;&ndash;yet.&rdquo; And his words were an
admission of his own feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes wandered thoughtfully from his friend to
the book shelves; and after a moment the other stirred
impatiently. Then his eyes came back to Jim&rsquo;s face. He
watched the passionate straining in them, that told of the
spirit working within. Nor could he help thinking what a
difference there might have been had Eve only married
this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better go back to the ranch,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
<p>But the light that suddenly leaped to Jim&rsquo;s eyes gave
him answer without the words which followed swiftly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t without seeing her, and
learning the truth from her own lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;ll never do, boy, if I know Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim became obstinate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he declared, with an ugly threat in his
passionate eyes. &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s Will&ndash;&ndash;if he&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking foolish.&rdquo; The sharpness of Peter&rsquo;s
voice silenced him. But it was only for a moment, and
later he broke out afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Peter, I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t listen to reason on
this matter. Eve is before all things in my life. I can&rsquo;t
help loving her, even if she is another&rsquo;s wife, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t if I could. See here,&rdquo; he went on, letting himself
go as his feelings took fresh hold of him, &ldquo;if Eve&rsquo;s
unhappy there must be some way of helping her. If he&rsquo;s
ruining her life he must be dealt with. If he&rsquo;s brutal to
her, if he&rsquo;s hurting her, I mean knocking her about,
Peter, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;smash him, if I swing for it! She&rsquo;s all
the world to me, and by Heavens I&rsquo;ll rid her of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter suddenly drew out his watch; he seemed wholly
indifferent to the other&rsquo;s storming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see her now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will &rsquo;ll be
down at the saloon playing &lsquo;draw.&rsquo; He don&rsquo;t generally
get home till Rocket closes down. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the two passed out into the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE BREAKING POINT</h3>
</div>
<p>Eve and Will were at supper. The girl&rsquo;s brown eyes
had lost their old gentle smile. Their soft depths no
longer contained that well of girlish hope, that trusting
joy of life. It seemed as if the curtain of romance had
been torn aside, and the mouldering skeleton of life had
been laid bare to her. There was trouble and pain in
her look, there was fear, too; nor was it quite plain the
nature of her fear. It may have been that fear of the
future which comes to natures where love is the mainspring
of responsibility. It may have been the fear of
the weaker vessel, where harshness and brutality are
threatened. It may have been a fear inspired by health
already undermined by anxiety and worry. The old
happy light was utterly gone from her eyes as she silently
partook of the frugal supper her own hands had prepared.</p>
<p>Will Henderson moodily devoured his food at the opposite
end of the table. The third of their household
was not there. Elia rarely took his meals with them.
He preferred them by himself, for he hated and dreaded
Will&rsquo;s tongue, which, though held in some check when
he was sober, never failed to sting the boy when Silas
Rocket&rsquo;s whiskey had done its work.</p>
<p>The meal was nearly finished, and husband and wife
had exchanged not a single word. Eve wished to talk;
there was so much she wanted to say to him. The flame
of her love still burned in her gentle bosom, but it was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
flame sorely blown about by the storm winds of their brief
married life. But somehow she could not utter the words
she wanted to. There was no encouragement. There
was a definite but intangible bar to their expression. The
brutal silence of the man chilled her, and frightened her.</p>
<p>Finally it was he who spoke, and he made some sort of
effort to hide the determination lying behind his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money have you got, Eve?&rdquo; he demanded,
pushing his plate away with a movement which
belied his tone. It was a question which had a familiar
ring to the ears of the troubled girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty dollars,&rdquo; she said patiently. Then she sighed.</p>
<p>The man promptly threw aside all further mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t sigh like that! You&rsquo;ll be sniveling
directly. One would think I was doin&rsquo; you an injury
asking you a simple question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, Will. I&rsquo;m thinking of what&rsquo;s going to
happen when that&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s got to last us a month.
Then I get my money from Carrie Horsley and Mrs.
Crombie. They owe me seventy dollars between them
for their summer suits. I&rsquo;ve got several orders, but folks
are tight here for money, and it&rsquo;s always a matter of
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get an advance from &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That frightened look suddenly leaped again into the
girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t start that game!&rdquo; the man retorted
savagely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to live, I s&rsquo;pose. You&rsquo;ll earn the
money. That sort of thing is done in every business.
You make me sick.&rdquo; He lit his pipe and blew great
clouds of smoke across the table. &ldquo;I tell you what it is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
we can&rsquo;t afford to keep your brother doing nothing all
the time. If you insist on keeping him you must find
the money&ndash;&ndash;somewhere. It&rsquo;s no use being proud. We&rsquo;re
hard up, and if people owe you money, well&ndash;&ndash;dun &rsquo;em
for it. I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but this darned business
of yours seems to have gone to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not gone to pieces, Will,&rdquo; Eve protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
made more money this last four months than ever before.&rdquo;
The girl&rsquo;s manner had a patience in it that came
from her brief but bitter experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s become of the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve&rsquo;s patience had its limits. The cruel injustice
of his sneering question drove her beyond endurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Will,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and you can sit there and ask
such a question! Where has it gone?&rdquo; She laughed
without any mirth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone with the rest, down at
the saloon, where you&rsquo;ve gambled it away. It&rsquo;s gone
because I&rsquo;ve been a weak fool and listened to your talk
of gambling schemes which have never once come off.
Oh, Will, I don&rsquo;t want to throw this all up at you. Indeed,
indeed, I don&rsquo;t. But you drive me to it with your
unkindness, which&ndash;&ndash;which I can&rsquo;t understand. Don&rsquo;t
you see, dear, that I want to make you happy, that I
want to help you? You must see it, and yet you treat
me worse&ndash;&ndash;oh, worse than a nigger! Why is it? What
have I done? God knows you can have all, everything
I possess in the world. I would do anything for you,
but&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Sometimes I think you have learned
to hate me. Sometimes I think the very sight of me
rouses all that is worst in you. What is it, dear? What
is it that has come between us? What have I done to
make you like this?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>She paused, her eyes full of that pain and misery
which her tongue could never adequately express. She
wanted to open her heart to him, to let him see all the
gold of her feelings for him, but his moody unresponsiveness
set her tongue faltering and left her groping blindly
for the cause of the trouble between them.</p>
<p>It was some moments before Will answered her. He
sat glaring at the table, the smoke of his pipe clouding
the still air of the neat kitchen. He knew he was facing
a critical moment in their lives. He saw dimly that he
had, for his own interests, gone a shade too far. Eve
was not a weakling, she was a woman of distinct character,
and even in his dull, besotted way he detected at
last that note of rebellion underlying her appeal. Suddenly
he looked up and smiled. But it was not altogether
a pleasant smile. It was against his inclination,
and was ready to vanish on the smallest provocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking things wrong, Eve,&rdquo; he said, and the
strain of attempting a conciliatory attitude made the
words come sharply. &ldquo;What do I want your money
for, but to try and make more with it? Do you think I
want you to keep me? I haven&rsquo;t come to that yet.&rdquo;
His tone was rapidly losing its veneer of restraint.
&ldquo;Guess I can work all right. No, no, my girl, you
haven&rsquo;t got to keep me yet. But money gets money,
and you ought to realize it. I admit my luck at &lsquo;draw&rsquo;
has been bad&ndash;&ndash;rotten!&rdquo; He violently knocked his pipe
out on a plate. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s got to change. I can play
with the best of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; they play a straight game.
What&rsquo;s losing a few nights, if, in the end, I get a big
stake? Why Restless helped himself to a hundred
dollars last night. And I&rsquo;m going to to-night.&rdquo;</p>

He sat glaring at the table, the smoke of his pipe clouding the still air of the neat kitchen.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Will, you&rsquo;ve said that every night for the last
month. Why not be fair with yourself? Your luck is
out; give it up. Will, give up the saloon for&ndash;&ndash;for my
sake. Do, dear.&rdquo; Eve rose and went round to the
man&rsquo;s side, and laid a tenderly persuasive hand upon
his shoulder. She was only waiting for a fraction of encouragement.
But that fraction was not forthcoming.
Instead he shook her off. But he tried to do it pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sit you down, Eve, and listen to me. I&rsquo;m going
to tell you something that I hadn&rsquo;t intended to, only&ndash;&ndash;only
you&rsquo;re bothering such a hell of a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His language passed. She was used to it now. And
she sat shrinking at his rebuff, but curious and half fearful
at what he might have to tell her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a flutter to-night, no matter what
comes, make your mind up to that. And, win or lose, it&rsquo;s
my last. Get that? But I&rsquo;ve got a definite reason for
it. You see I haven&rsquo;t been as idle as you think. I&rsquo;ve
been hunting around on the trail of Peter Blunt. Folks
all think him a fool, and cranky some. I never did.
He&rsquo;s been a gold prospector most of his life. And it&rsquo;s
not likely he don&rsquo;t know. Well, I&rsquo;m not giving you a
long yarn, and to cut it short, I&rsquo;m right on to a big find.
At least I&rsquo;ve got color in a placer up at the head waters,
and to-morrow I go out to work it for all it&rsquo;s worth.
No, I&rsquo;m not going to tell even you where it is. You see
it&rsquo;s a placer, and anybody could work it, and I&rsquo;d be cut
clean out if others got to know where it was. You
savvee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve nodded, but without conviction. The man detected
her lack of belief, and that brutal light which was
so often in his eyes now suddenly flamed up. But after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
a moment of effort he banished it, and resorted to an
imitation of jocularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now, old girl, hand over that thirty dollars. I&rsquo;m
going to make a &lsquo;coup,&rsquo; and to-morrow begins a period
of&ndash;&ndash;gold. I give you my word you shall get it&ndash;&ndash;sure as
I&rsquo;m a living man. I&rsquo;m not talking foolish. The shining
yellow stuff is there for the taking. And so easy,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited with a grin of cunning on his lips. He was
intoxicated with his own surety. And, curiously, well as
Eve knew him, that certainty communicated itself to her
in spite of her reason. But the matter of handing over
the thirty dollars was different.</p>
<p>A hard light crept into her eyes as she looked down at
him from where she stood. Though he did not know it,
he was rapidly killing all the love she had for him. Eve
was one of those women who can love with every throb
of their being. Self had no place in her. The man she
loved was, as a natural consequence, her all. Kill her
love and she could be as cold and indifferent as marble.
At one time in their brief married life those dollars would
never have been considered. They would have been his
without the asking. Now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She shook her head decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have them,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got to keep us for a month. If you depend on them
for a game, you had better wait till you get the gold
from your placer.&rdquo; She moved away, talking as she
went. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not only ourselves to consider. There&rsquo;s
Elia. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she got no further. The mention of her brother&rsquo;s
name suddenly infuriated the man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of that little devil!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
want those thirty dollars, d&rsquo;you understand?&rdquo; He
crashed his fist on the table and set the supper things
clattering. &ldquo;You talk to me of Elia! That devil&rsquo;s
imp has been in the way ever since we got married.
And d&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;m going to stand for him now?&rdquo;
He sprang to his feet, his eyes blazing with that fury
which of late he rarely took the trouble to keep in
check. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve preached to me
enough for one night, and, fool-like, I&rsquo;ve listened to you.
I listen to no more. So, just get busy and hand over
those dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if he was in a fury, he had contrived to stir Eve as
he had never stirred her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not get a cent of them,&rdquo; she cried, her eyes
lighting with sudden cold anger.</p>
<p>For a moment they stood eyeing each other. There
was no flinching in Eve now, no appeal, no fear. And
the man&rsquo;s fury was driving him whither it would. He
was gathering himself for a final outburst, and when it
came it was evident he had lost all control of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! I&rsquo;ll have those dollars if I have to take
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will flung his pipe to the ground and dashed at Eve
like a madman. He caught her by the shoulders, and
gripped the warm rounded flesh until the pain made her
writhe under his clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he demanded, with another
furious oath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have &rsquo;em. Speak! Speak,
you &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; or I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve was obdurate. Her courage was greater than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
her strength. He shook her violently, clutching at her
shoulders as though to squeeze the information he needed
out of her. But he got no answer, and, in a sudden access
of demoniacal rage, he swung her round and hurled
her across the room with all his strength. She fell with
a thud, and beyond a low moan lay quite still. Her
head had struck the sharp angle of the coal box.</p>
<p>In a moment the man had passed into the bedroom in
search of the money. Nor did he have to search far.
Eve kept her money in one place always, and he knew
where it was. Having possessed himself of the roll of
bills he came out into the kitchen. He looked about
him, and his furious eyes fell upon the prostrate form of
his wife. She was lying beside the coal box in the attitude
in which she had fallen. He went over to her,
and stood for a second gazing down at the result of his
handiwork.</p>
<p>But there was neither pity nor remorse in his heart.
For the time at least he hated her. She had dared to
defy him, she had twitted him with his gaming, she had
refused him&ndash;&ndash;in favor of Elia. He told himself all this,
and, as he looked down at the still figure, he told himself
it served her right, and that she would know better in
the future. But he waited until he detected the feeble
rise and fall of her bosom. Then he went out, conscious
of a certain feeling of relief in spite of his rage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A &ldquo;PARTY CALL&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>Peter led the way up the path from the gate of Eve&rsquo;s
garden. He had taken the lead in this visit; he felt it
was necessary. Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s frame of mind was not to
be trusted, should they encounter Henderson. He
knocked at the door, reassured that Eve was within by
the light in her parlor window.</p>
<p>At first he received no reply, and in silence the two
men waited. Then Peter knocked again. This time
Elia&rsquo;s voice was heard answering his summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter raised the latch, and, closely followed by Jim,
passed directly into the parlor. He glanced swiftly
round at the litter of dressmaking, but Eve was not there.
Jim&rsquo;s eyes, too, wandered over the familiar little room.
It was the first time he had entered it since the day he
had ridden over to ask her to marry him.</p>
<p>He saw Eve now in every detail of the furnishing; he
saw her in the work he had watched her at so often; he
saw her in the very atmosphere of the place, and the
realization of all he had lost smote him sorely. Then
there came to him the object of his present visit, and he
grew sick with the intensity of his feelings.</p>
<p>But the room was empty, and yet it had been Elia&rsquo;s
voice that summoned them to enter. With only the
briefest hesitation Peter started toward the kitchen door,
and Jim, his thoughts running riot over the past, mechanically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
followed him. And as they reached it, and
Peter&rsquo;s great bulk filled up the opening, it was the latter&rsquo;s
sharp exclamation that brought Jim to matters of the
moment. He drew close up behind his companion and
looked over his shoulder, and a startled, horror-stricken
cry broke from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried, and the horror in his voice was in
his eyes, and the expression of his face.</p>
<p>The scene held them both for a second, and for years
it lived in Jim&rsquo;s memory. The ill-lit kitchen with its
single lamp; the yellow rays lighting up little more than
the untidy supper-table with the misshapen figure of Elia
sitting on the far side of it, calmly devouring his evening
meal. The rest of the room was shadowy, except where
the light from the cook-stove threw its lurid rays upon
the white face and crumpled figure of Eve lying close
beside it upon the floor. Her eyes were closed, and a
great wound upon her forehead, with blood oozing slowly
from it, suggested death to the horrified men.</p>
<p>In an instant Jim was at Eve&rsquo;s side, bending over her,
seeking some signs of life. Then, as Peter came up, he
turned to him with a look of unutterable relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; Jim hurried on, &ldquo;water and a sponge, or
towel or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter crossed the room to the barrel, and dipped out
some water; and, further, he procured a washing flannel,
and hastened back with them to Jim, who was kneeling
supporting the girl&rsquo;s wounded head upon his hand.</p>
<p>And all the time Elia, as though in sheer idle curiosity,
watched the scene, steadily continuing his meal the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
while. There was no sort of feeling expressed in his
cold eyes. Nor did he display the least relief when Jim
assured him Eve was alive. Peter watched the boy, and
while Jim bathed her wounded forehead with a tenderness
which was something almost maternal, he questioned
him with some exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; he demanded, his steady eyes
fixed disapprovingly on the lad&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Guess she must ha&rsquo; fell some. Ther&rsquo;s
suthin&rsquo; red on the edge o&rsquo; the coal box. Mebbe it&rsquo;s her
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold indifference angered even Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you sit there with her, maybe, dying. Say, you&rsquo;re
pretty mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s indifference suddenly passed. He glanced at
Eve, then at the door, and he stirred uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know wher&rsquo; Will &rsquo;ud be. If I&rsquo;d called folks,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d got around an&rsquo; found &rsquo;em here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you fetch him?&rdquo; Peter broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come in jest after he&rsquo;d gone out, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found&ndash;&ndash;this?&rdquo; Peter indicated Eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim suddenly looked up, and his fierce eyes encountered
Peter&rsquo;s. The latter&rsquo;s tone promptly changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; he asked gently, and it was evident he
was trying to banish the thoughts which Elia&rsquo;s statement
had stirred in Jim&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming to,&rdquo; he said shortly, and turned again to his
task of bathing the injured woman&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>But it was still some minutes before the flicker of the
girl&rsquo;s eyelids proved Jim&rsquo;s words. Then he sighed his
relief and for a moment ceased the bathing and examined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the wound. Then he reached a cushion from one of the
kitchen chairs and folded it under her head.</p>
<p>The wound on her forehead was an ugly place just over
her right temple, and there was no doubt in his mind had
it been half an inch lower it would have proved fatal. He
knelt there staring at it, wondering and speculating. He
glanced at the corner of the box, and the thought of Eve&rsquo;s
height suggested the impossibility of a tumble causing
such a wound. Suspicion stirred him to a cold, hard rage.
This was no accident, he told himself, and his mind flew
at once to the only person who, to his way of thinking,
could have caused it. Will had left her just as Elia came
in; but Peter&rsquo;s voice called him to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best keep on with the bathing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And without a sign Jim bent to his task once more. A
moment later Eve stirred, and her eyes opened. At first
there was no meaning in her upward stare. Then the eyes
began to move, and settled themselves on Jim&rsquo;s face. In
a moment consciousness returned, and she struggled to sit
up. It was then the man&rsquo;s arm was thrust under her
shoulders, and he gently lifted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling better, Eve?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause; then a whispered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
came from her lips. But her wound began to bleed afresh,
and Jim turned at once to Elia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you and hunt up Doc Crombie,&rdquo; he said hastily.
And as the boy stirred to depart, he added in a tone that
was curiously sharp set, &ldquo;Then go on to the saloon and
tell Will Henderson to come right up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter interfered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him get the Doc,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to him&ndash;&ndash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>The two men exchanged glances, and Jim gave way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. But hurry for Crombie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Eve&rsquo;s voice demanding water held all Jim&rsquo;s
attention. And while Peter procured a cupful, he lifted
her gently in his arms and carried her into the parlor,
and laid her on an old horsehair settee, propping her carefully
into a sitting position. When the water was brought
she drank thirstily, and then, closing her eyes, sank back
with something like a sigh of contentment.</p>
<p>But with the first touch of the wet flannel which Jim
again applied to her head she looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell on the coal box,&rdquo; she said hastily. And before
Jim could answer Peter spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we guessed,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;Maybe
you were stooping for coal&ndash;&ndash;sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I was stooping for coal for the kitchen
stove. I must have got dizzy. You needn&rsquo;t send for the
doctor. I&rsquo;m all right, and the bleeding will stop. I&rsquo;ve
just got a headache. Please don&rsquo;t send for Will; I&rsquo;m
glad you haven&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d only be alarmed for&ndash;&ndash;for nothing&ndash;&ndash;and
really I&rsquo;m all right. Thank you, Jim, and you
too, Peter. You can&rsquo;t do anything more. Really you
can&rsquo;t and I don&rsquo;t want to spoil your evening. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to wait for the Doc, Eve,&rdquo; said Jim,
firmly.</p>
<p>Her eagerness to be rid of them was painfully evident,
and so unlike her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Peter, &ldquo;we better wait for the Doc,
Eve. You see we came down to pay you a party call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A party call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Y&rsquo;see Jim rode in from the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo; to pay you
a&ndash;&ndash;party call.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes steadied themselves on Jim&rsquo;s face. He
had drawn himself up a chair, and was sitting opposite
her. Peter was still standing, his great bulk shutting the
glare of the lamplight out of her eyes. She looked
long and earnestly into the man&rsquo;s face, as though she
would fathom the meaning of his visit before she in
any way committed herself. But she learned nothing
from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A party call&ndash;&ndash;after all this time, Jim?&rdquo; she asked,
with something like a wistful smile.</p>
<p>Jim turned away. He could not face the pathos in her
expression. His eyes wandered round the little room.
Not one detail of it was forgotten, yet it seemed ages and
ages since he had seen it all. He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said lamely, &ldquo;new married folks
don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve checked his explanation quickly. She didn&rsquo;t want
any. All she wanted was for them to go before Will
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know. And, besides, the ranch is a long
way. Yet&ndash;&ndash;why did you come to-night?&rdquo; She pressed
her hand to her forehead lest the fear in her eyes should
betray her.</p>
<p>The pause which followed was awkward. Somehow
neither of the men was prepared for it. Neither had
thought that such a question would be put to him. Peter
looked at Jim, who turned deliberately away. He was
struggling vainly for a way of approaching all he had to
say to this girl, and now that he was face to face with it
he realized the impossibility of his position. Finally it
was the girl herself who helped him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, very kind of you, anyway,&rdquo; she said, in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
low voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to think that I&rsquo;ve got friends thinking
about me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Eve,&rdquo; cried Jim, seizing his opportunity
with a clumsy rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking a heap&ndash;&ndash;lately.
You see&ndash;&ndash;Will Henderson&rsquo;s not working and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;folks
say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gossip says we&rsquo;re &lsquo;hard up,&rsquo;&rdquo; Eve added
bitterly. She knew well enough the talk that was rife.
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come in to see&ndash;&ndash;if it is true.&rdquo; She again
pressed a hand to her forehead. This time it was the
pain of her head which had become excruciating.</p>
<p>Jim nodded, and Peter&rsquo;s smiling eyes continued to
watch him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t exactly that,&rdquo; the former went on in his
straightforward way. &ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s so blazing hard to put it
so you can understand. You see, I&rsquo;ve been doing very
well, and&ndash;&ndash;you know I&rsquo;ve got a big bunch of cattle running
up in the foot-hills now&ndash;&ndash;I thought, maybe, seeing
Will isn&rsquo;t working, money might be a bit tight with you.
You see, we&rsquo;re folks of the world, and there&rsquo;s no fool
sentiment about us in these things; I mean no ridiculous
pride. Now, if I was down, and you&rsquo;d offered to help
me out, I&rsquo;d just take it as a real friendly act. And I just
thought&ndash;&ndash;maybe&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How much longer he would have continued to flounder
on it was impossible to tell, but Peter saw his trouble
and cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Eve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Jim wants to help you out.
Some folks have got busy, and he&rsquo;s heard that you&rsquo;re
hard pushed for ready dollars. That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim frowned at his bluntness, but was in reality immensely
relieved. Eve had been listening with closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
eyes, but now opened them, and they were full of a
friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter; thanks, Jim,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both very good to me, but&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t worry about
money. If things go right we have enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Eve,&rdquo; Jim exclaimed eagerly. &ldquo;If things
go right. Are they going right? Will they go right?
That&rsquo;s just it. Say, can&rsquo;t you see it hurts bad to think
you&rsquo;ve got to pinch, and that sort of thing? You can
surely take a loan from me. You&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve shook her head decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things will go right, believe me. Will has got something
up&ndash;&ndash;in the hills. He says it&rsquo;s going to bring us in
a lot.&rdquo; She turned wistful eyes upon Peter&rsquo;s rugged
face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something in your line,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Gold.
And he says&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She broke off with a look of sudden
distress. &ldquo;I forgot. I wasn&rsquo;t to say anything to&ndash;&ndash;to
anybody. Please&ndash;&ndash;please forget about it. But I only
wanted to show you that&ndash;&ndash;we are going to do very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Will&rsquo;s struck it rich.&rdquo; It was Peter&rsquo;s astonished
voice that answered her. The news had a peculiar interest
for him. &ldquo;Placer?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and easy to work. But you won&rsquo;t say a word
about it, will you? He told me not to speak of it. And
if he knew he would be so angry. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Eve,&rdquo; broke in Jim, gently. &ldquo;Your
secret is safe with us&ndash;&ndash;quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter said nothing. The news had staggered him for
a moment, and he was vainly trying to digest it. Jim
rose from his seat and leaned against the table. His attempt
had failed. She would have none of his help.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
But his coming to that house had told him, in spite of
Eve&rsquo;s reassurance, that the gossip was well founded.
There was trouble in Eve&rsquo;s home, and it was worse than
he had anticipated.</p>
<p>The girl eyed them both for a moment with a return
of that fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going now?&rdquo; she inquired, with an anxiety
she no longer tried to conceal. She felt so ill that it
didn&rsquo;t seem to matter what she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to wait till Doc Crombie&rsquo;s fixed you
up,&rdquo; said Peter, steadily. Then he added thoughtfully,
&ldquo;After that I&rsquo;m going to fetch Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve gasped. Swift protest rose to her lips, but it remained
unspoken, for at that moment there came the
sound of footsteps outside, and Elia led the forceful
doctor into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mrs. Henderson,&rdquo; he cried, nodding at the two
men. &ldquo;Winged your head some. Let&rsquo;s have a look,&rdquo;
he added, crossing to Eve&rsquo;s side and glancing keenly at
her wound. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;How did you do
it? Eh?&rdquo; he demanded, and Peter explained. The explanation
was made to save Eve what both he and Jim
knew to be a lie.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s blunt scorn was withering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! Leanin&rsquo; over the coal box? Fell on the
corner? Nonsense! Say, if you&rsquo;d fell clear off o&rsquo; the
roof on to that dogone box, mebbe you could ha&rsquo; done
that amount o&rsquo; damage. But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s eyes flashed indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if you&rsquo;d fix me up,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
<p>The rough doctor grinned and got to work. She had
made him suddenly realize that he was dealing with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
woman, and not one of the men of the village. He
promptly waived what had, in the course of years, become
a sort of prerogative of his: the right to bully. In
half an hour he had finished and the three prepared to
take their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll be all right now,&rdquo; Crombie said, in his
gruff but not unkindly way. Then, unable to check
entirely his hectoring, he went on with a sarcastic grin.
&ldquo;An&rsquo;, say, ma&rsquo;m, if you&rsquo;ve a habit o&rsquo; leanin&rsquo; so heavy
over the coal box, I&rsquo;d advise you to git the corners
rounded some. When falls sech as you&rsquo;ve jest bin takin&rsquo;
happen around they don&rsquo;t generly end with the first of
&rsquo;em. I wish you good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter also bade her good-night, and he and the doctor
passed out. Jim was about to follow when Eve stayed
him. She waited to speak till the others had passed out
of ear-shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;re real good,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
&ldquo;And I can never thank you enough. No,&rdquo; as he
made an attempt to stop her, &ldquo;I must speak. I didn&rsquo;t
want to, but&ndash;&ndash;but I must. It isn&rsquo;t money we want&ndash;&ndash;truth.
Not yet. But maybe you can help me. I don&rsquo;t
rightly know. You do want to, don&rsquo;t you? Sure&ndash;&ndash;sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. His eyes told her. At that moment he
would have done anything for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want to help me there&rsquo;s only one way.
Help him. Oh, Jim, he needs it. I don&rsquo;t know how
it&rsquo;s to be done, but&ndash;&ndash;for my sake&ndash;&ndash;help him. Jim, it&rsquo;s
drink&ndash;&ndash;drink and poker. They&rsquo;re ruining him. You
can only help me&ndash;&ndash;by helping him. No, don&rsquo;t promise
anything. Good-night, Jim. God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>She held out her hand to him and, in a paroxysm of
ardent feeling, he clutched it and kissed it passionately.
A moment later he was gone.</p>
<p>As the door closed Elia stepped into the light. The
girl had forgotten all about him. Now she was startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve, wot fer did you lie about that?&rdquo; he said, pointing
at her bandaged head.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s head was aching so that it seemed it would
split, and she closed her eyes. But the boy would not
be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lied, sis,&rdquo; he exclaimed vehemently, though his
face and eyes were quite calm. &ldquo;Will did that, &rsquo;cause
you wouldn&rsquo;t give him thirty dollars. I see him throw
you &rsquo;crost the room. I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve was wide-eyed now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him?&rdquo; she cried in alarm. Then she
paused. Suddenly her tone changed. &ldquo;Come here,
Elia,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
<p>The boy came toward her and she took one of his
hands and fondled it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you see him?&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the window. I was waitin&rsquo; fer supper.&rdquo;
In spite of her caress the boy was sulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, promise me you won&rsquo;t tell anybody. You
haven&rsquo;t, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell, sis, if you don&rsquo;t want me. But&ndash;&ndash;but
why don&rsquo;t you kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The three men were walking across the market-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Will Henderson&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; exclaimed Crombie
with a fierce oath, nodding his head back at Eve&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Jim and Peter offered no comment. Both had long
since realized the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gol durn him!&rdquo; cried the fiery doctor. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill
her&ndash;&ndash;if he don&rsquo;t get killed instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said nothing. Eve&rsquo;s passionate appeal to him was
still ringing in his ears. It was Peter who answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You goin&rsquo; to home, Doc? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; down to the
saloon&ndash;&ndash;to fetch Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo; It was Jim&rsquo;s startled inquiry. &ldquo;What
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to yarn some&ndash;&ndash;mebbe. You get right out
to the ranch, boy. An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t get around here till I send
you word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor stood for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He needs hangin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he declared. Then, in the
cheery starlight, he looked into the two men&rsquo;s faces and
grinned. He had a great knowledge of the men of his
village. &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he added, and abruptly strode
away.</p>
<p>The moment he had gone Jim protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to help him; we&rsquo;ve got
to get him clear of that saloon. It&rsquo;s not because I like
him or want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. But we got to help him. So, you get right
out to the ranch, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;leave him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>DEVIL DRIVEN</h3>
</div>
<p>The saloon was full and Rocket was busy. His face
glowed with funereal happiness. He was sombrely delighted
at the rapidity with which the tide of dollars was
flowing across his dingy counter. He was more than
ordinarily interested, too, which was somewhat remarkable.</p>
<p>The fact was Barnriff&rsquo;s scandal had received a fillip in
a fresh and unprecedented direction. McLagan had been
in, bringing two of his cow-punchers with him. The
hot-headed Irishman had crashed into the midst of Barnriff
with such a splash that it set the store of public comment
hissing and spluttering, and raised a perfect roar of
astonishment and outraged rectitude.</p>
<p>He had arrived late, after the usual evening game had
started. His first inquiry was for Jim Thorpe, and he
cursed liberally when told that nobody had seen him.
Then he fired his angry story at the assembled company
of villagers, and passed on to make camp at a rival ranch
five miles to the northwest.</p>
<p>It was a rapidly told story full of lurid trimmings, and,
judging by its force, came from his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s duffing, boys,&rdquo; he cried, with an oath, and a
thump on the bar which set the glasses, filled at his expense,
rattling. &ldquo;Dogone cattle-duffing! Can you beat
it? The first in five year, since Curly Sanders got gay,
and then spent a vacation treadin&rsquo; air. We got first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
wind of it nigh a week back, Jim an&rsquo; me. We missed a
bunch o&rsquo; backward calves. We let &rsquo;em run this spring
round-up, guessin&rsquo; we&rsquo;d round &rsquo;em up come the fall.
Well, say, Jim went to git a look at &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;they was way
back there by the foot-hills, in a low hollow&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; not a
blame trace or track of &rsquo;em could he locate. We just
guessed they was &lsquo;stray,&rsquo; and started in to round &rsquo;em up.
Well, the boys has been busy nigh on a week, an&rsquo; here,
this sundown, Nat Pauley an&rsquo; Jim Beason come riding in,
till their bronchos was nigh foundered, sayin&rsquo; a bunch
of twenty cows on the Bandy Creek station has gone too.
D&rsquo;you git that? Those blamed calves was on the Bandy
Creek range, too. It&rsquo;s darnation cattle-thievin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
hot on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Barnriff was stirred. It was more. It was up in
arms. There was no stronger appeal to its sympathies
than the cry of &ldquo;cattle-thief!&rdquo; As a village it lived on
the support of the surrounding ranches, and their ills became
the scourge of this hornet&rsquo;s nest of sharp traders.
McLagan had raised the cry here knowing full well the
hatred he would stir, and the support that would be accorded
him should he need it.</p>
<p>He had come and gone a veritable firebrand, and the
hot trail he had left behind him was smouldering in a
manner unhealthy for the cattle-thieves.</p>
<p>When Peter Blunt entered the saloon it was to receive
McLagan&rsquo;s tale from all sides. And while he listened to
the story, now garbled out of all semblance of its original
form by the whiskey-stimulated imaginations, he found
himself wondering how it came that Jim Thorpe had
given him no word of it. And he said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys,&rdquo; he observed, when he got a chance to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
speak, &ldquo;I only left Jim Thorpe a while back. He rode
in to see me. He didn&rsquo;t give me word of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Abe Horsley who explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McLagan came in looking for him. Jim&rsquo;s only got
the week old stuff. The news hit the ranch at sundown
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see more, Peter,&rdquo; broke in Smallbones viciously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see a vigilance committee right here, if this gambol
don&rsquo;t quit. Barnriff don&rsquo;t stand for cattle-duffin&rsquo; worth
a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upsets trade,&rdquo; lumbered Jake Wilkes, with the tail of
his eye on the busy Smallbones.</p>
<p>Gay laughed ponderously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smallbones&rsquo;ll show us how to form a corporation o&rsquo;
vigilantes. Though it ain&rsquo;t a finance job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that I will. I&rsquo;m live anyways. I&rsquo;ve had to do
with &rsquo;em before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get hanged,&rdquo; protested Jake, after heavy
thought. &ldquo;Guess you ain&rsquo;t got no kick coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones purpled to the roots of his bristly hair.
Jake irritated him to a degree, and the roar of laughter
which greeted the slow-witted baker&rsquo;s sally set him completely
on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I was on the other end of the rope,&rdquo; he retorted,
trying to turn the laugh, but the baker, with grave
deliberation, added to his score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was a real mean trick o&rsquo; fortune on us folks o&rsquo;
Barnriff,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>In the midst of the laughter Peter moved away to the
tables. He looked on here and there watching the varying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
fortunes with all the interest of his intensely human
mind. The weaknesses of human nature appealed to his
kindly sympathy as they can only to those of large heart.
He begrudged no man moments when the cares of everyday
life might be pushed into the background, however
they might be obtained.</p>
<p>He argued that the judgment of Nature needed no
human condemnation added to it. Human penalty must
be reserved for the administration of social laws. To his
mind the broad road of evil would automatically claim its
own without the augmentation of the loads of human
freight borne thither on the dump-carts of the self-righteous.
Rather it was his delight to hold out a hand to a
poor soul in distress, even if his own ground were none
too secure.</p>
<p>At one table he saw the winnings almost entirely in one
corner, and the expressive yet grim faces of the other
players only too plainly showed their feelings. He noticed
the greedy manner in which the losers clutched up their
cards at each fresh deal. Their hope was invincible, and
he loved them for it. It may have been the hope such
as a drowning man is credited with. It may have been
the sportsman&rsquo;s instinct seeking a fresh turn in fortune&rsquo;s
wheel. It may have been inspired by the malicious hope
of the winner&rsquo;s downfall. But he felt it was healthy, in
spite of the ethical pronouncements of those who repose
on the pedestal of their own virtues. It was, to his mind,
the spirit of the fighter in the game of life, a spirit, which,
even though misdirected, must never be unreservedly deplored.
To his mind it were better to fight a battle, however
wrong be the prompting instinct, than to run for
the shelter of supine ineptitude.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>He moved slowly round the room till he came to the
table where Will Henderson was playing. He had reached
his goal, and his self-imposed task had begun. His eyes
quickly scanned the table and the faces of the five players.
The other four were men he knew, not actually of the
village, but hard-faced, lean ranchmen, men who came
from heaven alone knew where, and whose earthly career
was scarcely likely to bring about the final completion of
the circle.</p>
<p>For the moment they mattered little. It was Will he
was concerned with; nor was it with his fortunes in the
game. The hand had just finished, and he saw one of the
men rake in a small pot of &ldquo;ante&rsquo;s&rdquo; without a challenge.
While the fresh dealer was shuffling the cards he caught
Will&rsquo;s eye. He read there the anxiety of a gambler whose
luck is out. He glanced at his attenuated pile of chips,
and took his opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel like missing the deal, Will?&rdquo; he asked casually.</p>
<p>But the set of the face lifted to him warned him of the
negative which swiftly followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m not yearning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter followed it up while the cards were being cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to speak to you <i>particular</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of doubt suddenly leaped into Will&rsquo;s eyes, and he
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter eyed the tumbler of whiskey at the man&rsquo;s elbow.
He noted the heavy eyes in the good-looking young
face. But the cards were dealt, and he waited for the
finish of the hand. He saw Will bet, and lose on a
&ldquo;full-house.&rdquo; His pile was reduced to four fifty-cent
chips and the man&rsquo;s language was full of venom at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
opponent&rsquo;s luck. The moment he ceased speaking Peter
began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s hurt bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Doc Crombie&rsquo;s
only just left her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will started. He had forgotten. A sudden fear held
him silent, while he waited for more. But no more was
forthcoming. Only the blue eyes of his informant
searched his face, and, to the guilty man, they seemed to
be reading to the very depths of his soul. Something
urged him, and he suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best deal four hands,&rdquo; he said hastily to his
companions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he moved away from the table unsteadily, and
Peter made a guess at the quantity of bad whiskey he
had consumed. He led the way from the tables, and,
once clear of them, glanced over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We best get outside,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Will was already regretting his game. The feeling
of guilt was passing. It had only been roused by
the suddenness of Peter&rsquo;s announcement. A look of resentment
accompanied his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to miss more than a couple of hands,&rdquo;
he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we best hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter led the way through the crowd, and the two
passed out. With the glare and reek of the bar behind
them he dropped abreast of Will, and walked him steadily
in the direction of his own hut. At first Henderson
failed to notice the intention; he was waiting for Peter
to speak. He was waiting for the &ldquo;particular&rdquo; he had
spoken of. Then, as it did not seem to be forthcoming,
he promptly rebelled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell me right here,&rdquo; he said, with distinct
truculence, and coming to a dead standstill.</p>
<p>Peter reached out, and his powerful hand closed about
the other&rsquo;s upper arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve got to tell you can be told in my shack.
You best come right on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your darned hand off me!&rdquo; cried Will, angrily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me here, or I get back to my game.&rdquo; He
tried to twist himself free. But Peter&rsquo;s hand tightened
its hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quitting that saloon for to-night, Will,&rdquo; he
said quietly.</p>
<p>The other laughed, but he had a curiously uncomfortable
feeling under his anger. Suddenly he put more
exertion into his efforts to release himself, and his fury
rose in proportion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn your soul, let me go!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>But Peter suddenly seized his wrist with his other hand,
and it closed on it like a vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive me to force,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;That saloon
is closed to you to-night. Do you understand? I&rsquo;ve
got to say things that&rsquo;ll likely change your way of thinking.
Don&rsquo;t be a fool; come on up to my shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so full of calm strength, so full
of conviction in Peter&rsquo;s tone that it was not without its
effect. That guilty thought rose again in Will&rsquo;s mind,
and it weakened his power of resistance. His rage was
no less, but now there was something else with it,
an undermining fear, and in a moment he ceased to
struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, and moved forward at the other&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>Peter released his wrist, but kept his hold on his arm.</p>
<p>And they walked in silence to the &ldquo;shack.&rdquo; Will had
long known the gold prospector, and had become so accustomed
to the mildness of his manner, as had all the
village, that this sudden display of physical and moral
force brought with it an awakening that had an unpleasant
flavor. Then, too, his own thoughts were
none too easy, and the picture of Eve as he had last
seen her would obtrude itself, and created, if no gentler
feeling, at least a guilty nervousness that sickened his
stomach.</p>
<p>Peter said that Doc Crombie had only just left her.
What did that mean? Only just left her, and&ndash;&ndash;it had
occurred nearly two hours ago. He was troubled. But
his trouble was in no way touched with either remorse
or pity. He was thinking purely of himself.</p>
<p>Of course she had recovered, he told himself. He had
watched her breathing before he left her. Yes, he had
ascertained that. She had been merely stunned. Ah, a
sudden thought! Perhaps she had told them what had
happened. A black rage against her suddenly took hold
of him. If she had&ndash;&ndash;but no. Even though he was&ndash;&ndash;as
he was, he realized, as bad natures often will realize in
others better than themselves, Eve&rsquo;s loyalty and high-mindedness.
It could not be that. He wondered. And
wondering they reached their destination.</p>
<p>Peter let him pass into the hut, and, following quickly,
lit the lamp. Then he pointed at the only comfortable
seat, and propped himself against the table, with the light
shining full on Will&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will,&rdquo; he began, without any preamble, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
to take a fall&ndash;&ndash;quick. You&rsquo;ve got to get such a big fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
that maybe it&rsquo;ll hurt some&ndash;&ndash;at first. But you&rsquo;ll get better&ndash;&ndash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man assumed indifference. He felt that he must
steady himself. He wanted to get the measure of the
other before giving vent to those feelings which were
natural to him since drink had undermined all that was
best in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve nearly killed your wife to-night,&rdquo; Peter went
on, with a new note of harshness in his voice. &ldquo;Look
you, I&rsquo;m not going to preach. It&rsquo;s not our way here, and
none of us are such a heap good that preaching comes
right from us. I&rsquo;m warning you, and it&rsquo;s a warning
you&rsquo;ll take right here, or worse&rsquo;ll come. Now I don&rsquo;t
know the rights of what has happened between you and
Eve, but I&rsquo;ll sort of reconstruct it to you in my own way,
and it matters nothing if I am right or wrong. Eve and
you had words. What about I can only guess at.
Maybe it was money, maybe the saloon, maybe poker.
You two must have got to words, which ended by you
brutally pitching her on to the edge of the coal box, and
nearly killing her. After that you went out, leaving her
to die&ndash;&ndash;by your act&ndash;&ndash;if it took her that way. Mark you,
she didn&rsquo;t fall. She couldn&rsquo;t have&ndash;&ndash;and smashed her forehead
as she did. She told us she did, but that, I guess,
was to shield you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she didn&rsquo;t give you this pretty yarn?&rdquo; inquired
Will, sarcastically. He was feeling better. He gathered
that Eve was not going to die. &ldquo;You kind of made it
up on your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Peter, quite unmoved. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;Doc
Crombie, Jim Thorpe, and I. We made it up, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
you choose to call it, because we&rsquo;ve eyes and ears and
common sense. And Doc Crombie knows just about
how much force it would take to smash her head as it
was smashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were you fellows doing in my house?&rdquo;
Will demanded, his anger gaining ground in proportion
to the abatement of his fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in <i>Eve&rsquo;s</i> house,&rdquo; answered Peter, drily, &ldquo;for
the reason that we wished to have a chat with her. That
is, Jim and I. Doc Crombie came because we&rsquo;d a notion
we were sorry for Eve, and didn&rsquo;t want her to die on our
hands. That&rsquo;s why we were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Thorpe was there, eh? And who&rsquo;s to say that
you and he didn&rsquo;t do the mischief? Guess Jim hates
things enough, seeing I married Eve. She&rsquo;d got no
broken head when I left her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t to lie about it, Will,&rdquo; Peter said calmly.
&ldquo;Least of all to me. But that makes no odds. As I
said, you&rsquo;ve got to take a fall. Barnriff&rsquo;s got ears
and eyes that puts it wise to a lot. It&rsquo;s wise to how
things have been going with you and Eve. It&rsquo;s wise
to the fact you&rsquo;re bumming your living out of her,
that you&rsquo;re a drunken, poker-playing loafer, and that
you&rsquo;re doing it on her earnings. And Barnriff, headed
by a few of us, and Doc Crombie, aren&rsquo;t going to stand
for it. If you don&rsquo;t get busy you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s trouble
for you, and if, from this out, Barnriff gets wise to your
ill-treatment of Eve, in any way&ndash;&ndash;God help you. You&rsquo;ll
get less mercy shown you than you showed that poor
girl to-night. That&rsquo;s what I brought you here to say.
And I&rsquo;d like to add a piece of friendly advice. Don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
you show your face in Rocket&rsquo;s saloon to get a drink or
deal a hand at poker for a month or&ndash;&ndash;well, I needn&rsquo;t
warn you further of what&rsquo;s going to happen. If you&rsquo;ve
got savvee you&rsquo;ll read through the lines. Maybe you&rsquo;ll
take this hard&ndash;&ndash;I can see it in your face. But you&rsquo;re a
man, and you&rsquo;ve got some grit&ndash;&ndash;well, get right out and
do things. That&rsquo;s your chance here in Barnriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will Henderson&rsquo;s face was a study while he listened to
his arraignment and final sentence by the mild Peter
Blunt. At first rage was his dominant emotion, but it
gave way before the mild but resolute fashion in which
the large man poured out the inexorable flow of the
sentence. And somehow for a moment those calm words
got hold of all that was vital in him, and he shrank before
them. But neither did this feeling last. A bitter hatred
rose up in his heart, a black, overmastering, passionate
desire for vengeance fired him, and proportionate with
its strength a cunning stirred which held it in check.
He put an abrupt question, nor could he keep his angry
feelings out of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s helped in this?&rdquo; he said savagely.
&ldquo;No need to ask his reason. Gee, it&rsquo;s a mean man that
can&rsquo;t take his med&rsquo;cine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bark up that tree, Will,&rdquo; said Peter,
patiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all responsible for this&ndash;&ndash;the whole of
Barnriff.&rdquo; Then he smiled. &ldquo;You see, Doc Crombie
has approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Henderson saw fit to change his
manner. It seemed almost as if the enormity of his
offense had been suddenly brought home to him, and
contrition had begun to stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Peter, as if the ways of things were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
queer,&rdquo; he said, after a long pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something
that&rsquo;ll keep me out of Barnriff a good deal in future.
I&rsquo;ve had it a week an&rsquo; more back. I&rsquo;ve struck a good
thing up in the hills.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;A real good
thing&ndash;&ndash;and it&rsquo;s easy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; the other said genuinely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold. Something in your line, eh? Placer.
Gee, I&rsquo;ll make things hum when I&rsquo;ve taken the stuff
out of it. S&rsquo;truth, I&rsquo;ll buy some of &rsquo;em! And sell &rsquo;em,
too, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, eh? Well, good luck to you. I&rsquo;m glad&ndash;&ndash;if
it&rsquo;s to make a man of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second Will&rsquo;s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right; it&rsquo;ll make a man of me. And,
being a man, there are some things I&rsquo;m not likely to forget.
Say, you&rsquo;ve passed sentence&ndash;&ndash;you and your friends,
which include Jim Thorpe. You won&rsquo;t have to carry it
out. I&rsquo;ll knuckle down, because I know you all. But,
by gee! I&rsquo;ve struck what you&rsquo;re looking for, and when
I&rsquo;ve gathered the dust I&rsquo;ll make some folks jump to my
own tune! Get that, Peter Blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter smiled at the sudden outburst of malicious rage.
Then his face grew cold, and his even tone checked the
tide of the other&rsquo;s impotent rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But meanwhile Barnriff is top
dog, an&rsquo; you best write that down in big letters, and set
it where you can read it easily. Now you can go home
and look after your poor wife. And remember, as sure
as there&rsquo;s a God in heaven, if you make that girl&rsquo;s life a
misery, or in any way hurt her, you&rsquo;ll sicken at the
thought of Barnriff. Now you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s quiet manner carried unpleasant conviction to
the departing man. The conviction was so strong that he
obeyed him to the letter. He walked without hesitation,
without any desire to do otherwise, in the direction of his
home. But this was an almost mechanical result. His
mind was occupied in a way that would have astonished
the men of Barnriff.</p>
<p>His fury had gone. His brain was filled with cold,
hard thoughts, the more cruel for their lack of heat. His
thoughts were of that which he had struck in the hills,
and of a revenge which he felt he could play off on these
people who demanded that he should guide his life as
they dictated. He saw subtle possibilities which gave
him enjoyment. He would work, and work hard. And
then the manner of the revenge he would take! He
laughed.</p>
<p>Then his laugh died out, for Jim Thorpe wholly occupied
his thoughts, and there was no room for laughter
where Jim was concerned. He remembered Jim was
making money&ndash;&ndash;and how. Suddenly he paused in his
walk, and a delighted exclamation broke from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! The very thing I&rsquo;ve been looking for. He&rsquo;s
got that land from McLagan. He&rsquo;s going to run a
ranch. He&rsquo;s going to play big dog. Gee! That&rsquo;s the
game! Say, master Jim,&rdquo; he went on, apostrophizing
the absent man he had so easily learned to hate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make you a sick man before the snow falls. Gee!
You&rsquo;d butt in in my affairs. You&rsquo;re standing Eve&rsquo;s
friend.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Go ahead, boy. I&rsquo;ll play up
to you. Eve shall tell you I&rsquo;m a reformed man, and
you&rsquo;ll feel better. And then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by the time he reached his home there was apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
a complete transformation in him. The old
moody selfishness and brutality toward his wife seemed
to have fallen from him like a hideous cloak. He played
the game he intended with such an appearance of good
faith that the sick woman suddenly experienced the first
relief and comfort she had known for months.</p>
<p>He waited on her, repentant and solicitous, till she
could hardly believe her senses, and she even forgot to
ask the result of his gamble. And the next morning,
when necessity forced her to ask him for money, she was
content that he returned to her something under ten
dollars of that which he had stolen from her.</p>
<p>Later in the day he left for the hills, and from that
moment an entire change came over Eve&rsquo;s whole life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE WORKING OF THE PUBLIC MIND</h3>
</div>
<p>The month following Will&rsquo;s departure from the village
saw stirring times for the citizens of Barnriff.</p>
<p>The exploding of Dan McLagan&rsquo;s bombshell in their
midst was only the beginning; a mere herald of what was
to follow. Excitement after excitement ran riot, until
the public mind was dazed, and the only thing that remained
clear to it was that crime and fortune were racing
neck and neck for possession of their community.</p>
<p>The facts were simple enough in themselves, but the
complexity of their possibilities was a difficult problem
which troubled Barnriff not a little.</p>
<p>In the first instance McLagan&rsquo;s alarm set everybody
agog. Then a systematic wave of cattle-stealing set in
throughout the district. Nor were these depredations
of an extensive nature. Cattle disappeared in small
bunches of from ten to forty head, but the persistence
with which the thefts occurred soon set the aggregate
mounting up to a large figure.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rdquo; lost two more bunches of cattle within a week. The
&ldquo;<img src='images/diamond.png' alt='diamond' /> P&rsquo;s&rdquo;
followed up with their quota of
forty head, which set &ldquo;old man&rdquo; Blundell raving through
the district like a mad bull. Then came a raid on the
&ldquo;U&ndash;&ndash;U&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Sandy McIntosh cursed the rustlers in the
broadest Scotch, and set out to scour the country with
his boys. Another ranch to suffer was the &ldquo;crook-bar,&rdquo;
but they, like the &ldquo;TT&rsquo;s,&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t tell the extent of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
their losses definitely, and estimated them at close on
to thirty head of three-year-old beeves.</p>
<p>The village seethed, furious with indignation. For
years Barnriff had been clear of this sort of thing, and, as
a consequence, the place had been left to bask in the sun of
commercial prosperity consequent upon the thriving condition
of the surrounding ranches. Now, that prosperity
was threatened. If the ranches suffered Barnriff must
suffer with them. Men spoke of a vigilance committee.
But they spoke of it without any real enthusiasm. The
truth was they were afraid of inaugurating an affair of
that sort. There was scarcely a man in the place but
had at some time in his life felt the despotic tyranny of a
vigilance committee. Though they felt that such an
organization was the only way to cope with the prevailing
trouble they cordially dreaded it.</p>
<p>Then, in the midst of all this to-do, came the news of
Will&rsquo;s rich strike in the hills. He had discovered a
&ldquo;placer&rdquo; which was yielding a profit of fabulous dimensions.
Of how rich his strike really was no one seemed
to possess any very definite information. In the calm
light of day men spoke of a handsome living wage, but,
as the day wore on, and Silas Rocket&rsquo;s whiskey did its
work, Will&rsquo;s possible wealth generally ended in wild
visions of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Under this inspiring news the commercial mind of Barnriff
was stirred; it was lifted out of the despondency into
which the news of the cattle-stealing had plunged it. It
cleaned off its rust and began to oil its joints and look to
its tools. With the first news it, metaphorically, &ldquo;reared
up.&rdquo; Then Will came into town with a bag of dust and
nuggets, and the optical demonstration set lips smacking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
and eyes gleaming with envy and covetousness. They
asked &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; But Will shook his head with a
cunning leer. Let them go and seek it as he had to do,
he said. And forthwith his advice was acted upon by
no less than a dozen men, who promptly abandoned
profitable billets for the pursuit of the elusive yellow ore.</p>
<p>Two weeks later Will again visited the village. This
time he staggered the folks by taking his wife to Abe
Horsley&rsquo;s store, and spending two hundred dollars in dry-goods
and draperies for her. He flashed a &ldquo;wad&rdquo; of bills
that dazzled the lay-preacher&rsquo;s eyes, and talked of buying
a ranch and building himself a mansion on it.</p>
<p>Nor did he visit the saloon. He was sober, and looked
the picture of health and cheerfulness. He talked freely
of his strike and its possibilities. He swaggered and
patronized his less fortunate fellow townsmen, until he
had them all by the ears and set them tumbling over
each other to get out after the gold.</p>
<p>He was followed and watched. Men shadowed his
every movement in the hope of discovering his mine,
but he was too clever for them. They kept his trail to
the hills, but there he quickly lost them. He never took
the same route twice, and, on one occasion, traveled for
three days and nights, due north, before entering the
foot-hills. He was as elusive as the very gold his pursuers
sought.</p>
<p>One by one the would-be prospectors returned disappointed
to the village, and again took up their various
works, forced to the sorry consolation of listening to the
tales of Will&rsquo;s wealth, and watching him occasionally run
in to the village and scatter his money broadcast amongst
the storekeepers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>Of all Barnriff Peter Blunt seemed the least disturbed.
He went calmly on with his work, smiling gently whenever
spoken to on the subject. And his reply was invariably
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not handling &lsquo;placer,&rsquo;&rdquo; he told Doc Crombie
one day, when that strenuous person was endeavoring to
&ldquo;pump&rdquo; him on the subject. &ldquo;I allow &lsquo;placers&rsquo; are easy,
and make a big show. But my &lsquo;meat&rsquo; is high grade ore
that&rsquo;s going to work for years. His strike don&rsquo;t interest
me a heap, except it proves there&rsquo;s gold in plenty around
these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor could he be drawn into further discussion in the
matter.</p>
<p>Yet his interest was far greater than he admitted. He
was puzzled, too. He could not quite make out how he
had missed the signs of alluvial deposit. Both scientifically
and practically he was a master of his hobby, in spite
of local opinion. Yet he had missed this rich haul under
his very nose. That was his interest as a gold miner. But
there was another side to it, which occupied his thoughts
even more. And it was an interest based on his knowledge
of Will Henderson, and&ndash;&ndash;various other things.</p>
<p>He was out at a temporary camp at one of his cuttings
with Elia, who, since his first sojourn with the prospector,
now frequently joined him in his work. They had just
finished dinner, and Peter was smoking and resting. Elia
was perched like a bird on an upturned box, watching his
friend with cold, thoughtful eyes. Suddenly he blurted
out an irrelevant remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks has quit chasin&rsquo; Will Henderson,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stared at him intently. He was becoming accustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
to the curious twists of the lad&rsquo;s warped mind, but
he wondered what he was now driving at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too slim for &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Elia went on, gazing steadily
into the fire. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s slim, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;bad. But he ain&rsquo;t as bad
as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter smiled at the naive confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking foolishly,&rdquo; he said, in a tone his smile
belied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am. Say, I could track Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to. But I&rsquo;ll need your help. See here,
Peter, I&rsquo;ll need to get away from sis, an&rsquo; if I get out without
sayin&rsquo;, she&rsquo;ll set half the village lookin&rsquo; to find me. If
I&rsquo;m with you, she won&rsquo;t. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you want to track him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause he&rsquo;s bad&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t got no &lsquo;strike.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s on
some crook&rsquo;s work. Maybe he&rsquo;s cattle duffin&rsquo;. I mean
to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes grew cold and hard, and the boy watching
him read what he saw with a certainty that was almost
uncanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been thinking that always, too,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in his strike, neither,&rdquo; he added
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Peter, guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; the boy persisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s
bad. Say, he&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; Eve bad takin&rsquo; that money he
sends her. An&rsquo; she don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supposing it&rsquo;s as you say&ndash;&ndash;and you found out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys &rsquo;ud hang him. And&ndash;&ndash;and Eve would be
quit of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d break her heart. She&rsquo;s your sister, and
would sooner cut off her right hand than hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia laughed silently. There was a fiendishness in his
manner that was absolutely repulsive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; he said decidedly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
break Eve&rsquo;s heart worth a cent. She don&rsquo;t care a cuss for
him, since&ndash;&ndash;since that night. Eve&rsquo;s a heap high-toned in
her notions. He hit her. He nigh killed her. She ain&rsquo;t
one to fergit easy.&rdquo; He laughed again. &ldquo;I ken see clear
through Eve. If Will was dead, in six months she&rsquo;d
marry agin. D&rsquo;ye know who? Jim Thorpe. She&rsquo;s jest
a fool gal. She&rsquo;s allus liked Jim a heap. That night&rsquo;s
stickin&rsquo; in her head. She ain&rsquo;t fergot Jim&ndash;&ndash;nor you. Say,
d&rsquo;you know what she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;? When Will sends her
money she sets it aside an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t touch it. She don&rsquo;t buy
things for herself. She hates it. She lives on her sewin&rsquo;.
That&rsquo;s Eve. I tell you she hates Will, same as I do, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter smiled incredulously. He didn&rsquo;t believe that the
girl&rsquo;s love for her husband was dead. Possibly her attitude
deceived the lad, as well it might. How could one
of his years understand a matter of this sort? But he
thought long before he replied to the venomous tirade.
He knew he must stop the lad&rsquo;s intention. He felt that
it was not for him to hunt Will down, even&ndash;&ndash;even if he
were a cattle-thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, laddie,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I promised you
all the gold I found in this place. I&rsquo;m going to keep that
promise, but you&rsquo;ve got to do something for me. See?
Now I&rsquo;m not going to say you can&rsquo;t track Will if you&rsquo;ve
a notion to. But I do say this, if he&rsquo;s on the crook, and
you find it out, you&rsquo;ll promise only to tell me and no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
else. You leave Will to me. I&rsquo;m not going to have you
hanging your sister&rsquo;s husband. You&rsquo;ve got to promise
me, laddie, or you don&rsquo;t see the color of my gold. And
don&rsquo;t you try to play me up, either, because I&rsquo;ll soon know
if you are. Are you going to have that gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face was obstinately set. Yet Peter realized
that his cupidity was fighting with the viciousness of his
twisted mind, and had no doubt of the outcome. The
thought of seeing Will hang was a delirious joy to Elia.
He saw the man he hated suffering, writhing in agony at
the end of a rope, and dying by inches. It was hard to
give it up. Yet the thought of Peter&rsquo;s gold&ndash;&ndash;not the man
himself, of whom, in his strange fashion, he was fond&ndash;&ndash;was
very sweet. Gold! It appealed to him, young as he
was, as it might have appealed to a mind forty years older;
the mind of a man beaten by poverty and embittered by
a long life of hopeless struggle. Finally, as Peter expected,
cupidity won the day, but not without a hot verbal
protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool man some ways, Peter,&rdquo; the boy at last
declared in a snarling acquiescence. &ldquo;What for d&rsquo;you
stop me? Gee, you&rsquo;ve nothing to help him for. Say, I&rsquo;d
watch him die, I&rsquo;d spit at him. I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But his
frenzy of evil joy made it impossible for him to find further
words. He broke off, and, a moment later, went on
coldly: &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do as you say. Gee, but it makes
me sick. Eh? No. I won&rsquo;t tell other folk. Nor Eve&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;but
you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to give me that gold, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be
rich. Say, I&rsquo;ll be able to buy buggies, an&rsquo; hosses, an&rsquo;
ranches, an&rsquo; things? I&rsquo;ll be able to have plenty folks
workin&rsquo; for me? Gee! I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em work. I&rsquo;ll make
&rsquo;em sick to death when I get that gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>Peter rose abruptly to return to work. The boy&rsquo;s diseased
mind nauseated him. His heart revolted with each
fresh revelation of the terrible degeneracy that possessed
the lad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN&rsquo;S INSTINCT</h3>
</div>
<p>The women of Barnriff were as keenly alive to the
prevailing excitements as the men. Perhaps they were
affected differently, but this was only natural. The village,
with its doings, its gossip, was their life. The
grinding monotony of household drudgery left them
little margin for expansion. Their horizon possessed
the narrowest limits in consequence. Nor could it be
otherwise. Most of them lived in a state of straining
two ends across an impossible gulf, and the process reduced
them to a condition of pessimism which blinded
them to matters beyond their narrow focus.</p>
<p>But just now the cloud had lifted for a moment and a
flutter of excitement gave them an added interest in
things, and relieved them from the burden of their usual
topics. When they met now matters of housekeeping
and babies, and their men-folk, were thrust aside for the
fresher interests. And thus Pretty Wilkes, blustering
out of Abe Horsley&rsquo;s emporium in a heat of indignation,
found little sympathy for her grievance from Mrs. Rust and
Jane Restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll give Carrie a word or two when I see her,&rdquo;
she cried, viciously flourishing a roll of print in the faces
of her friends. &ldquo;If Abe isn&rsquo;t a money grubbing skinflint
I just don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;. Look at that stuff. Do I
know print? Do I know pea-shucks! He&rsquo;s been tryin&rsquo;
to sell me faded goods that never were anything else but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
faded, at twice the price they ever were, when they
couldn&rsquo;t have been worth half of it if the color hadn&rsquo;t
faded that never did, because there wasn&rsquo;t no decent
color to fade. I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the two women&rsquo;s attention was wandering. They
were gazing across at Eve&rsquo;s house where Annie Gay was
just disappearing through the doorway. Pretty saw her,
too, and, in a moment, her anger merged into the general
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, if that ain&rsquo;t the third time this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanin&rsquo; Annie?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Rust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chasin&rsquo; dollars,&rdquo; added Jane Restless, with a sniff.</p>
<p>Pretty laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, and promptly answered herself.
&ldquo;Guess her man&rsquo;s taught her. However, I don&rsquo;t
blame her. Dollars are hard enough to come by in this
place. Say, they tell me Eve&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousands,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rust, her eyes shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t she lucky?&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care who knows it. I envy her good an&rsquo; plenty. Thousands!
Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s to be envied a heap,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rust. &ldquo;I &rsquo;lows all men has their faults, but Will Henderson
ain&rsquo;t no sort of bokay of virtues. He&rsquo;s a drunken
bum anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he knocks her about,&rdquo; added Pretty, with a snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s pilin&rsquo; up the dollars for her,&rdquo; Jane urged,
still lost in serious contemplation of the fabulous sums her
simple mind attributed to Eve&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<p>But Pretty Wilkes had no sympathy with such excuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dollars or no dollars, I wouldn&rsquo;t change places
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
with Eve for a lot. Guess there&rsquo;s some folk as would sell
their souls for dollars,&rdquo; she said, eyeing Jane Restless
severely. &ldquo;But if dollars means having Will Henderson
behind &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;d rather get out an&rsquo; do chores all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; acquiesced Mrs. Rust, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Will&rsquo;s a whiskey souse an&rsquo; poker playin&rsquo; bum.
What I sez is, give me a fool man like my Rust, who&rsquo;s
no more sense than to beat hot iron, an&rsquo; keep out o&rsquo; my
way when I&rsquo;ve a big wash doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Pretty. &ldquo;An&rsquo; if I&rsquo;m any judge,
that&rsquo;s just &rsquo;bout how pore Eve feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore?&rdquo; sniggered Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;pore.&rsquo;&rdquo; Pretty&rsquo;s manner assumed its most pronounced
austerity. &ldquo;That gal ain&rsquo;t what she was, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;
I can&rsquo;t get the rights of it. What for does she keep
right on with her needle, with all those dollars? She
don&rsquo;t never laff now for sure. There&rsquo;s something on her
mind, and it&rsquo;s my belief it&rsquo;s Will Henderson. Say, Kate
Crombie told me that Eve never spent any o&rsquo; those dollars,
an&rsquo; it was her belief she ain&rsquo;t never touched &rsquo;em.
<i>She</i> says it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause of him. <i>She</i> says it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause she hates
Will, has hated him ever since that time she fell agin the
coal box. That was Will. Kate said so; and her man
fixed Eve up. Say, he orter been lynched. An&rsquo; if the
men-folk won&rsquo;t do it, then we ought to. It makes my
blood boil thinkin&rsquo; of it. Pore Eve! I allus liked her.
But she&rsquo;s fair lost her snap since she&rsquo;s got married.
Guess it &rsquo;ud bin different if she&rsquo;d married Jim Thorpe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, with some antagonism.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s a nice seemin&rsquo; feller
enough, someways, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Rust, eagerly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo; much, on&rsquo;y there&rsquo;s queer yarns goin&rsquo; of
that same Jim Thorpe. Restless was yarning with two
of McLagan&rsquo;s boys, who are out huntin&rsquo; the stolen cattle.
Well, they got a yarn from one of the boys of the
&lsquo;<img src='images/diamond.png' alt='diamond' /> P.&rsquo;s&rsquo;
Course I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s right, but this
feller seen a big bunch of cattle running where Jim keeps
his stock. An&rsquo; he swore positive they was re-branded
with Jim&rsquo;s mark. You know,
&lsquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />,&rsquo;
which, as he pointed
out, was an elegant brand for covering up an original
brand. Them boys, Restless said, was off to look up the
stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane told her story with considerable significance, and,
for the moment, her two friends were held silent. Then
Pretty Wilkes gathered herself to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but Jim&rsquo;s McLagan&rsquo;s foreman. He don&rsquo;t
need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. Folks wouldn&rsquo;t suspect him easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The force of Jane&rsquo;s argument almost carried conviction.
But the blacksmith&rsquo;s wife liked Jim, and could
not let Jane carry off honors so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim ain&rsquo;t no cattle-thief,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she hurried
on, with truly feminine logic, &ldquo;if he was he&rsquo;d be
cleverer than that. Mark me, Jim&rsquo;s too dead honest.
Now, if it was Will Henderson&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gossip was becoming too concentrated, and
Pretty helped it into a fresh channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talkin&rsquo; of Will Henderson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Kate Crombie
told me the Doc&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make him say where he gets
his gold&ndash;&ndash;in the interest of public prosperity. That&rsquo;s
how she called it. That&rsquo;s why he ain&rsquo;t showed up in
town for nigh three weeks. Guess he&rsquo;ll go on keepin&rsquo;
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Doc&rsquo;s up again Will someways,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most folks is,&rdquo; added Mrs. Rust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc&rsquo;s a bad one to get up against,&rdquo; observed Pretty.
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s going to make Will talk, our men-folk &rsquo;ll all get
chasin&rsquo; gold. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. Seems to me a
roast o&rsquo; beef in the cook-stove&rsquo;s worth a whole bunch o&rsquo;
cattle that ain&rsquo;t yours. Well, I&rsquo;ll get on to home, an&rsquo;
get busy on the children&rsquo;s summer suitings&ndash;&ndash;if you can
call such stuff as Abe sells any sort o&rsquo; suitings at all.
Good-bye, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the matrons and hurried away. A moment
later Jane Restless went on to the butcher&rsquo;s, while Mrs.
Rust pottered heavily along to Smallbones&rsquo; store to obtain
some iron bolts for her husband.</p>
<p>But these good women wronged Annie Gay when they
hinted at time-serving to Eve on account of the money
her husband was making. Her friendship for Eve was
of much too long standing, and much too disinterested
for it to be influenced by the other&rsquo;s sudden rise to prosperity.
As a matter of fact it made her rejoice at the
girl&rsquo;s sudden turn of fortune. She was cordially, unenviously
glad of it.</p>
<p>She found Eve hard at work at her sewing-machine, in
the midst of an accumulation of dress stuff, such as might
well have appalled one unused to the business. But the
busy rush of the machine, and the concentrated attitude
of the sempstress, displayed neither confusion nor worry
beyond the desire to complete that which she was at
work on.</p>
<p>Eve glanced up quickly as Annie came in. She gave
her a glance of welcome, and silently bent over her work
again. Annie possessed herself of a chair and watched.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
She liked watching Eve at work. There was such a
whole-hearted determination in her manner, such a businesslike
directness and vigor.</p>
<p>But just now there was more to hold her interest. The
girl was not looking well. Her sweet young face was
looking drawn, and, as she had told her that very morning,
she looked like a woman who had gone through all
the trials of rearing a young family on insufficient means.
Now she was here she meant to have it out with Eve.
She was going to abandon her r&ocirc;le of sympathetic onlooker.
She was going to delve below the surface, and
learn the reason of Eve&rsquo;s present unsmiling existence.</p>
<p>All this she thought while the busy machine rattled
down the cloth seams of Jane Restless&rsquo;s new fall suit.
The low bent head with its soft wavy hair held her earnest
attention, the bending figure, so lissome, yet so frail as it
swayed to the motion of the treadle. She watched and
watched, waiting for the work to be finished, her heart
aching for the woman whom she knew to be so unhappy.</p>
<p>How she would have begun her inquiries she did not
know. Nor did she pause to think. It was no use. She
knew Eve&rsquo;s proud, self-reliant disposition, and the possibilities
of her resenting any intrusion upon her private
affairs. But she was spared all trouble in this direction,
for suddenly the object of her solicitude looked up, raised
her needle, and drew the skirt away from the machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness that&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then
she leaned back in her chair and stretched her arms and
eased her aching back. &ldquo;Annie, I&rsquo;m sick of it all. Sick
to death. It&rsquo;s grind, grind, grind. No lightness, nothing
but dark, uncheered work.&rdquo; She turned her eyes to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
window with a look of sorrowful regret. &ldquo;Look at the
sunlight outside. It&rsquo;s mocking, laughing. Bidding us
come out and gather fresh courage to go on, because it
knows we can&rsquo;t. I mean, what is the use of it if we do
go out? It is like salt water to the thirsty man. He
feels the moisture he so needs, and then realizes the
maddening parching which is a hundred times worse than
his original state. Life&rsquo;s one long drear, and&ndash;&ndash;and I
sometimes wish it were all over and done with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie&rsquo;s pretty eyes opened wide with astonishment.
Here was the self-reliant Eve talking like the veriest
weakling. But quick as thought she seized her opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Eve, surely you of any folk has no right to get
saying things. You, with your husband heapin&rsquo; up the
dollars. Why, my dear, you don&rsquo;t need to do all this.
I mean this dressmakin&rsquo;. You can set right out to do
just those things you&rsquo;d like to do, an&rsquo; leave the rest for
folks that has to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her chair and came to her friend&rsquo;s side,
and gently placed an arm about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she went on kindly, &ldquo;I came here now to
talk straight to you. I didn&rsquo;t know how I was to begin
for sure, but you&rsquo;ve saved me the trouble. I&rsquo;ve watched
you grow thinner an&rsquo; thinner. I&rsquo;ve sure seen your poor
cheeks fadin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; your eyes gettin&rsquo; darker and darker all
round &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve seen, too, and worst of all, you don&rsquo;t
smile any now. You don&rsquo;t never jolly folks. You just
look, look as though your grave was in sight, and&ndash;&ndash;and
you&rsquo;d already give my man the contract. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s gentle, earnest, half-humorous manner
brought a shadowy smile to Eve&rsquo;s eyes as she raised them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
to the healthy face beside her. And Annie felt shrewdly
that she&rsquo;d somehow struck the right note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me, Annie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good
for a few years yet.&rdquo; Then her eyes returned to the
gloomy seriousness which seemed to be natural to them
now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve got the miserables, or&ndash;&ndash;or
something. P&rsquo;raps a dash of that sunlight would do
me good. And&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she freed herself almost roughly from Annie&rsquo;s
embracing arm and stood up. She faced the girl almost
wildly, and leaned against the work-table. Her eyes grew
hot with unshed tears. Her face suddenly took on a look
of longing, of yearning. Her whole attitude was one of
appeal. She was a woman who could no longer keep to
herself the heart sickness she was suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am sick. It&rsquo;s not bodily though, sure,
sure. Oh, sometimes I think my heart will break, only&ndash;&ndash;only
I suppose that&rsquo;s not possible,&rdquo; she added whimsically.
&ldquo;Ah, Annie, you&rsquo;ve got a good man. You love him, and
he loves you. No hardship would be a trouble to you,
because you&rsquo;ve got him. I haven&rsquo;t got my man, and,&rdquo;
she added in a low voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him. That&rsquo;s it!
Stare, child! Stare and stare. You&rsquo;re horrified&ndash;&ndash;and so
am I. But I don&rsquo;t want him. I don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t! I
don&rsquo;t! I hate him. I loathe him. Say it, Annie. You
must think it. Every right-minded woman must think
it. I&rsquo;m awful. I&rsquo;m wicked. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off on the verge of hysteria and struggled
for calmness. Annie sensibly kept silent, and presently
the distracted woman recovered herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything like that again, dear. I mustn&rsquo;t,
but&ndash;&ndash;but I had to say it to some one. You don&rsquo;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
what it is to keep all that on your mind and not be able
to tell any one. But it&rsquo;s out now, and I&ndash;&ndash;I feel better,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie came to her side and placed her arm about her
waist. Her action was all sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to listen,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;I knew
there was things troublin&rsquo;. You can tell me anything&ndash;&ndash;or
nothing. And, Eve, you&rsquo;ll sure get my meanin&rsquo; when I
say the good God gave me two eyes to use, an&rsquo; sometimes
to sleep with. Well, dear, I mostly sleep at nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve tried to smile, but it was a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good woman, Annie, and&ndash;&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t know
how I&rsquo;d have got on all this time without you. But sit
you down and listen. I&rsquo;ve begun now, and&ndash;&ndash;and I must
go on. Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you quite why, but I want to tell
it to somebody, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll feel better. You said I
don&rsquo;t need to do all this,&rdquo; she hurried on, pointing at the
dressmaking. &ldquo;I do. It&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps me
from running away, and breaking my marriage vows altogether.
Will&rsquo;s got no love for me, and I&ndash;&ndash;my love for
him died weeks ago. Maybe with those sharp eyes of
yours you&rsquo;ve seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie nodded and Eve went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened, Annie, and&ndash;&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t know why.
Will&rsquo;s a different man, but it&rsquo;s not that. No,&rdquo; she added
thoughtfully, &ldquo;somehow I&rsquo;m not frightened of him now.
I&ndash;&ndash;I hate him too much. But I&rsquo;m frightened, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung herself upon the worn settee, and lifted a pair
of gloomy eyes to her friend&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I can never touch
his money, nor the things he buys. I want nothing from
him, either for Elia or myself. I&rsquo;m married to him and
that I can&rsquo;t undo. Would to God I could! But I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
never take anything from the man I do not love, and my
love for Will is dead&ndash;&ndash;dead. No, Annie, I must go on
working in my own way, and I only hope and pray my
husband will keep away. Maybe he will. Maybe when
he&rsquo;s made a big pile out of his&ndash;&ndash;claim he will go away
altogether, and leave me in peace with Elia. I&rsquo;m
hoping for it&ndash;&ndash;praying for it. Oh, my dear, my dear,
what a mistake I&rsquo;ve made! You don&rsquo;t know. You
can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence for some moments. Annie was
thinking hard. Suddenly she put a sharp question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Eve. This fear you was saying. How can
you be frightened? What of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the effect of her words. Eve&rsquo;s
brown eyes suddenly dilated. She looked like a hunted
woman. And Annie shrank at the sight of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said with a shiver. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t
describe it. It&rsquo;s to do with Will. It&rsquo;s to do with&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
glanced about her fearfully&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;his money, his gold
find. Don&rsquo;t question me, because I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m
afraid. I think I first got afraid through Elia. He&rsquo;s a
queer lad&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t know how queer he is at times.
Well&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she swallowed as though with a dry throat&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;well,
from the first, when&ndash;&ndash;when Will found gold Elia
laughed. And&ndash;&ndash;and every time we speak about it he
laughs, and will say nothing. Oh, I wish I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie&rsquo;s question came with a curious abruptness.
Eve stared. And when she spoke it was almost to
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want to know. Only I&ndash;&ndash;I wish
I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>Annie suddenly came over to her friend&rsquo;s side. She
took her hands in hers and squeezed them sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve, I don&rsquo;t guess I&rsquo;ve got anything to say that can
help you. But whenever you want to talk things that&rsquo;ll
relieve you, why, you can just talk all you like to me.
But don&rsquo;t you talk of these things to any other folk.
Sure, sure, girl, don&rsquo;t you do it. You can just trust me,
&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got so bad a memory. Other folks hasn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; now to get my man&rsquo;s dinner. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent over and kissed the girl&rsquo;s thin cheek with a
hearty smack. But, as she left the house, there was a
grave light such as was rarely, if ever, seen in her merry
eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>BRANDED</h3>
</div>
<p>There is no calm so peaceful, no peace so idyllic as
that which is to be found on a Western ranch on a fine
summer evening. Life at such a time and in such a place
is at its smoothest, its almost Utopian perfection. The
whole atmosphere is laden with a sense of good-fellowship
between men and between beasts. The day&rsquo;s work is
over, and men idle and smoke, awaiting the pleasures of
an ample fare with appetites healthily sharp-set, and
lounge contentedly, contemplating their coming evening&rsquo;s
amusement with untroubled minds.</p>
<p>And the beasts which are their care. Fed to repletion
on the succulent prairie grasses they know nothing but
contentment. The shadow of the butcher&rsquo;s knife has no
terrors for them. They live only for their day. And
the evening, when their stomachs are full and repose is in
sight, is the height of their contentment.</p>
<p>Then, too, Nature herself is at her gentlest. The fierce
passion of heat has passed, the harsher winds have died
down, the worrying insects are already seeking repose.
There is nothing left to harry the human mind and
temper. It is peace&ndash;&ndash;perfect peace.</p>
<p>It was such an evening on the ranch of the &ldquo;AZ&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
All these conditions were prevailing, except that the mind
of Dan McLagan, the owner, was disturbed. Six of his
boys were out on the special duty of searching for stolen
cattle. This was bad enough, but Dan was fretting and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
chafing at the unpleasant knowledge that the epidemic of
cattle stealing was spreading all too quickly.</p>
<p>He was never a patient man. His Celtic nature still
retained all its native irritability, and his foreman, Jim
Thorpe, had ample demonstration of it. He had spent several
uncomfortable half hours that day with his employer.
He was responsible for the working of the ranch. It was
his to see that everything ran smoothly, and though the
depredations of cattle-thieves could hardly come under
the heading of his responsibilities, yet no employer can
resist the temptation of visiting his chagrin on the head
of his most trusted servant.</p>
<p>The hue and cry had been in progress for several weeks,
and as yet no result of a hopeful nature had been obtained.
And, in consequence, at every opportunity Dan
McLagan cursed forcibly into the patient ears of his
foreman.</p>
<p>Now, Jim was enjoying a respite. Dan had retired to
his house for supper, and he was waiting for his to be
served. He was down at the corrals, leaning on the
rails, watching the stolid milch cows nuzzling and devouring
their evening hay. His humor was interested.
They had eaten all day. They would probably eat until
their silly eyes closed in sleep. He was not sure they
wouldn&rsquo;t continue to chew their cud amidst their bovine
dreams. Each cow was already balloon-like, but the
inflation was still going on. And each beast was still
ready to horn the others off in its greediness.</p>
<p>He thought, whimsically, that the humbler hog was
not given a fair position in the ranks of gluttony. Surely
the bovine was the &ldquo;limit&rdquo; in that basest of all passions.
One cow held his attention more particularly than the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
others. She was small, and black and white, and her
build suggested Brittany extraction. She ran a sort of
free lance piracy all round the corral. Her sharp horns
were busy whenever she saw a sister apparently enjoying
herself too cordially. And in every case she drove the
bigger beast out and seized upon her choicest morsel.</p>
<p>Nor could he help thinking how little was the difference
between man and beast. It was only in its objective.
The manner was much the same. Yes, and
the very means employed created in him an impression
favorable to the hapless quadruped. Surely their battle
for existence was more honest, more natural.</p>
<p>His mood was pessimistic, even for a man who sees
the traffic which is his keenest interest threatened by a
marauding gang of land pirates. Maybe it was the
wearing hours of McLagan&rsquo;s nagging that caused his
mood. Maybe it was an inclination brought about by
the long train of disappointments that had been his as
he trod his one-way trail. Maybe, as the cynical might
suggest, his liver was out of order. However, whether
it was sheer pessimism, or even the shadow cast by approaching
events, he felt it would be good when the
evening was past, and he could forget things in the
blessed unconsciousness of sleep.</p>
<p>But his meditations were suddenly disturbed. The
ranch dogs started their inharmonious chorus, and experience
taught him that there are only two things which
will stir the lazy ranch dog to vocal protest; the advent of
the disreputable sun-downer, and the run of driven cattle.</p>
<p>He quickly discovered, at sight of a thick rising
dust to the westward of the ranch, that the present disturbance
was not caused by any ragged &ldquo;bum.&rdquo; Cattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
were coming in to the yards, and it needed little imagination
on his part to guess that some of the boys on
special duty were running in lost stock.</p>
<p>His pessimism vanished in a moment, and in its place a
keen enthusiasm stirred. If it were some of the lost
stock then they would probably have news of the thieves.
Maybe even they&rsquo;d made a capture. He hurried at once
in the direction of the approaching cattle. Nor was he
alone in his desire to learn the news. Every man had
left his supper at the bunk house to greet the newcomers.</p>
<p>The incoming herd was still some distance away, but
the bunch was considerable judging by the cloud of dust.
Jim found himself amongst a group of the boys, and
each and all of them were striving to ascertain the identity
of those who were in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo;s two o&rsquo; them, sure,&rdquo; exclaimed Barney Job,
after a long scrutiny. &ldquo;Leastways I ken make out two.
The durned fog&rsquo;s that thick you couldn&rsquo;t get a glimpse
o&rsquo; Peddick&rsquo;s flamin&rsquo; hair in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Barney,&rdquo; cried the lantern-faced owner of
the fiery red hair. &ldquo;Anyways a sight o&rsquo; my hair &rsquo;ud be
more encouragin&rsquo; than your ugly &lsquo;map.&rsquo; Seems to me,
bein&rsquo; familiar with my hair &rsquo;ll make the fires of hell,
you&rsquo;ll likely see later, come easier to you when they git
busy fumigatin&rsquo; your carkis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! that&rsquo;s an elegant word,&rdquo; cried Hoosier Pete, a
stripling of youthful elderliness. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ve bin
spellin&rsquo; out Gover&rsquo;ment Reg&rsquo;lations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. San&rsquo;tary ones. Barney&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo;
scoured in a kettle o&rsquo; hot water,&rdquo; said Peddick, with
a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needs it,&rdquo; muttered a surly Kentuckian.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; interrupted Barney, quite undisturbed by his
comrades&rsquo; remarks upon his necessity for careful ablutions.
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s Joe Bloc an&rsquo; Dutch Kemp. I&rsquo;d git
Dutch&rsquo;s beard anywher&rsquo;s. You couldn&rsquo;t get thro&rsquo; it with
a hay rake. Sure,&rdquo; he went on, shading his eyes, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
them an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re drivin&rsquo; them forty three-year-olds that
was pinched up at the back o&rsquo; the northern spurs.
Say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he broke off, concentrating upon the oncoming
cattle even more closely. Everybody was doing the
same. Jim had also recognized the two cow-punchers.
And he, like the rest, was wondering and speculating as
to the news that was to be poured into their curious ears
directly.</p>
<p>The cattle were running and it was evident the two
boys were in a hurry for their supper, or to deliver their
news. The waiting crowd cleared the way. And one of
the boys, at Jim&rsquo;s order, hurried down to the corrals to
receive them. He stood by, joined by several others, to
head the beasts into their quarters.</p>
<p>They came with a rush of shuffling, plodding feet
bellowing protest at the hurry, or welcome at sight of
the piles of hay that one or two of the men were already
pitching into the corral for their consumption. And in
less than five minutes they were housed for the night.</p>
<p>Then it was that Jim greeted the two cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boss&rsquo;ll be pleased, boys. Glad to see you back,
Dutchy, and you, too, Joe. Guess you&rsquo;ll have things to
report so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were out of their saddles and loosening their
cinchas. They eyed him curiously without attempting
to acknowledge his greeting. The rest of the men had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
gathered round. And now it was noticeable that while
they pointedly ignored their foreman, the newcomers,
equally markedly, exchanged friendly nods and grins with
their colleagues. Just for a moment Jim wondered.
Then annoyance added sharpness to his words. He was
not accustomed to being treated in this cool fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best come right up to my shack and report,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You can get supper after. I&rsquo;ll need to know at
once&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best get a look at them beasties fust,&rdquo; said Joe, in a
harsh tone, and with an unmistakable laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; sniggered Dutchy, with an insolent look into
Jim&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The studied insult of both the men was so apparent
that all eyes were turned curiously upon the foreman.
For Jim Thorpe was popular. More than popular. He
was probably the best-liked man on the range. Then,
too, Jim, in their experience, was never one to take
things &ldquo;lying down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dark, clear brows drew ominously together, and his
eyes narrowed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, the sun&rsquo;s hurt you some, boys, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
asked sharply. Then he went on rapidly, his teeth clipping
with each sentence: &ldquo;See here, get right up to my
shack. I&rsquo;ll take that report. And I don&rsquo;t need any talk
about it. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though the men remained silent the insolence of
their eyes answered him. Dutchy slung his saddle over
his shoulder and stood while Joe picked up his belongings.
And in those moments his eyes unflinchingly fixed
his foreman, and a smile, an infuriating smile of contempt,
slowly broke over his heavy Teutonic features.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>It was too much for Jim. He pointed at his shack.
&ldquo;Hustle!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>But before the men had time to move away, two of the
boys, who had elected to obey their comrade&rsquo;s suggestion,
came running up from the corral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boss,&rdquo; cried Barney, excitedly, &ldquo;get a peek at
their brands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was there any mistaking the man&rsquo;s anxiety&ndash;&ndash;even
awe. There was a general rush for the corral. And by
the time Jim reluctantly reached the fences he heard
smothered exclamations on all sides of him. He came to
the barred gateway and peered over at the cattle inside.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught his eye was the broadside of
a big steer. On its shoulder was a brand, at which he
stared first incredulously, but presently with horrified
amazement. It was the familiar
&ldquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />.&rdquo;
He looked at
others. Everywhere he saw his own brand, &ldquo;double-star
twice,&rdquo; as it was popularly known, on cattle which he
recognized at a glance as being some of his employer&rsquo;s
finest half-bred Polled Angus stock.</p>
<p>His feelings at that moment were indescribable. Astonishment,
incredulity, anger all battled for place, and
the outcome of them all was a laugh at once mirthless
and angry. He turned on the two men waiting with their
shouldered saddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your report&ndash;&ndash;up at the shack.&rdquo; And he
pointed at his hut, fifty yards away.</p>
<p>The men moved off obediently. And Jim, left to his
own unpleasant thoughts, followed them up.</p>
<p>Half-way to the hut he was joined by McLagan. The
Irishman had seen the cattle come in, and was anxious to
learn the particulars. His manner, after his recent ill-humor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
was almost jocular. He realized that these were
cattle he had lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jim, those boys have picked up a dandy bunch
of the lost ones. How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the foreman&rsquo;s humor did not by any means fit in
with his employer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t count &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting
the boys&rsquo; report. You best come along. It looks like
being interesting.&rdquo; Just for a moment a half-smile lit his
face.</p>
<p>Dan glanced at him out of the tail of his eyes and fell
in beside him. His foreman&rsquo;s manner was new, and he
wondered at it. However, Jim made no effort to open
his lips again until they reached the hut.</p>
<p>When they came up the boys were waiting outside the
door. Jim promptly led the way in, angrily conscious of
the meaning looks which passed between them.</p>
<p>Once inside, and Dan had seated himself on the bed,
Jim called the two men in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along in, boys,&rdquo; he cried, and his manner had
become more usual. He understood their attitude now,
and somehow he found himself sympathizing with their
evident suspicions. After all, he had grown into a
thorough cattleman. &ldquo;Speak up, lads. Let&rsquo;s get the
yarn. The boss wants to hear where you found those
cattle of his&ndash;&ndash;re-branded with my own brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan sat up with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was a study. But chiefly it expressed a belief
that he was being laughed at. Jim looked squarely into
his half-resentful eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those cattle they&rsquo;ve just brought in are branded with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
my brand. You know the brand. You helped me design
it.
&lsquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />&rsquo;
And,&rdquo; he added whimsically, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
mighty fine one for obliterating original brands, now I
come to study it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dan turned sharply on the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; he said; and there was no pleasantness
in his tone.</p>
<p>It was Joe Bloc who took the lead. Dutchy, though
speaking the language of the West freely enough, had, in
moments of involved explanation, still the Teutonic failing
of involving the verb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, boss,&rdquo; said Joe, his eyes steadily fixed on the
foreman&rsquo;s unflinching face, &ldquo;we got the news in Barnriff.
We&rsquo;d been out for nigh four days, and we&rsquo;d decided to
ride in here to get fresh plugs. Ours wus good an&rsquo; done,
an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d set &rsquo;em in Doc Crombie&rsquo;s barn, an&rsquo; had got over
to the saloon for a feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dan&rsquo;s sarcasm had no effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how, boss. Wal, right in the bar was one of
the
&lsquo;<img src='images/diamond.png' alt='diamond' /> P&rsquo;
boys&ndash;&ndash;one of old man Blundell&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d got a tidy yarn, sure, an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; we was your
hands, an&rsquo; his yarn was to do with your stock, he handed
it to us with frills. He&rsquo;d just got in from the hills, wher&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d been trailin&rsquo;. He said he&rsquo;d run into Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s
stock, tucked away in as nice a hollow of sweet grass as
you&rsquo;d find this side of Kentucky. Wal, he hadn&rsquo;t no suspicion,
seein&rsquo; whose beasties they were, an&rsquo; he was for
makin&rsquo; back. He&rsquo;d started, he said, when somethin&rsquo;
struck him. Y&rsquo;see he guessed of a sudden it was a
mighty big bunch for a ranch-foreman to be running, an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
ther&rsquo; was such a heap o&rsquo; half-bred Polled Angus amongst
&rsquo;em. Wal, seein&rsquo; that kind was your specialty, he just
guessed he&rsquo;d ride round &rsquo;em an&rsquo; git a peek at the brands.
Say, as he said, the game was clear out at once. They&rsquo;d
every son-of-a-cow got
&lsquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />&rsquo;
on &rsquo;em, but nigh haf wus
re-brands <i>over an&rsquo; blottin&rsquo; out the old one</i>. He got to
work an&rsquo; cut out an&rsquo; roped one o&rsquo; them half-breeds, an&rsquo;
hevin&rsquo; threw him, got down an looked close. The
original brand had been burned out, an&rsquo; the
&lsquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />&rsquo;
whacked deep over it. That&rsquo;s just all, boss. We got
out an&rsquo; brought the bunch in&ndash;&ndash;that is, them we knew
belonged to the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ominous silence followed the finish of his story.
The smile on Jim&rsquo;s face seemed to be frozen and meaningless.
Dan was staring intently at his boots and flicking
them with his quirt. Joe turned his head and exchanged
a smile of meaning with Dutchy, and both men
shifted into an easy pose, as much as to say, &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ve found the cattle duffer for you.&rdquo; The moments
passed heavily, then suddenly Dan looked up. There
was storm in his eyes. He had forgotten the cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you waitin&rsquo; for?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Get
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all the thanks the men got for the unctuously
given story, and their hard work.</p>
<p>They vanished rapidly through the door, and hastened
to air their grievance and repeat their story with added
&ldquo;frills&rdquo; to ready ears at the bunk house.</p>
<p>Jim gazed through the doorway after them, and Dan
furtively watched him for some silent moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>The tone of his inquiry was peculiar. There was no
definite anger in it, nor was it a simple question. Yet it
stung the man to whom it was addressed in a way that
set his teeth gritting, and the blood running hot to his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he retorted. And their eyes met with the
defiance of men of big physical courage.</p>
<p>Dan was the first to avert his gaze, but it was only to
hide that which lay behind in his thoughts. And when
he spoke there was a harsh smile in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ha&rsquo; ye got to say t &rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he jerked a thumb in
the direction of the bunk house&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that feller&rsquo;s yarn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s answer was unhesitating. He shrugged as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s no definite reason to doubt it. There
are the cattle. They&rsquo;re all re-branded with my brand.
I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em. The hand that did it was a prentice
hand, though. That&rsquo;s the only thing. The veriest kid
could detect the alteration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brand.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s eyes were still averted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s my brand. There&rsquo;s no need for more than
two eyes to see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLagan&rsquo;s quirt again began to beat his boot-leg. Jim
understood the temper lying behind that nervous movement.
He felt sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wher&rsquo; d&rsquo;ye keep your brands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one here and one up in the hills, in my little
implement shack, where I run my cattle. I keep that
there for convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was groping under the bed on which Dan was
reclining. He heard the reply, but chose to ignore it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>But he knew by its tone that suspicion had been driven
home in this cattleman&rsquo;s mind. He drew an iron out
from amongst the litter under the bed, and held it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the iron,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be well to compare
it on the brands. It is identical with the iron I
keep up in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s eyes met again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;for convenience.&rdquo; There was a sharpness in
the foreman&rsquo;s acquiescence.</p>
<p>The Irishman&rsquo;s eyes grew hot. The whites began to
get bloodshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s fer you to see if that iron fits, an&rsquo;,
if so&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Dan&rsquo;s evident heat his tone was frigid, and
its suggestion could no longer be ignored. Jim Thorpe,
conscious of his innocence, was not the man to accept
such innuendoes without protest. Suddenly his swift
rising anger took hold of him, and the fiery protest which
McLagan had intended to call forth broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, McLagan,&rdquo; he cried, vainly trying to
keep his tone cool, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with you about four years.
You know something of my history, and the folks I
spring from. You know more than any one else of me.
For four years I&rsquo;ve worked for you in a way, as you,
yourself, have been pleased to say in odd moments of
generosity, in a way that few hired men generally work
out here in the West. You&rsquo;ve trusted me in consequence.
And you&rsquo;ve never found me shirking responsibilities,
nor slacking. You&rsquo;ve helped me get together a
bunch of cattle with a view to becoming independent,
and shown me in every way your confidence. You&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
even offered to lease me grazing. These latter things
have not been without profit to you. That&rsquo;s as it should
be. However, I just mention these things to point the
rise in confidence which has grown up between us. You
understand? Now the cattle stealing begins. These
cattle are brought in here with my brands on. There is
no doubt they are your steers. You listen to the story
of the manner of their finding. You witness the cold
suspicion of me which those two men possess. Those
four years go for nothing. Your confidence won&rsquo;t stand
the least strain. You do not accuse me straight out, but
show me the suspicion with which you are contaminated
in a manner unworthy of an honest man. I tell you it&rsquo;s
rotten. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s despicable. Do you think I&rsquo;m going
to sit down under this suspicion? It will be all over the
countryside by to-morrow, and I&ndash;&ndash;I shall be a branded
man. I tell you I&rsquo;m going to sift this matter to the bottom.
But make no mistake. Not for your sake&ndash;&ndash;nor
for anybody else but myself. Those four years of hard
honest work don&rsquo;t count with you. Well, they shan&rsquo;t
count with me. I&rsquo;ll stay here with you so that I&rsquo;m
handy whenever wanted&ndash;&ndash;you understand me, I suppose&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;wanted.&rsquo;
But I&rsquo;ll thank you to let me pursue my investigations
in the way I choose. Your work shan&rsquo;t suffer.
If I don&rsquo;t lay my hands on the thief or thieves in a
month&rsquo;s time, then write me down a wrong &rsquo;un. If I do
round &rsquo;em up I&rsquo;ll at once take my leave of you, for I&rsquo;ve
no use for a man of your evident calibre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing when he finished speaking. His dark
eyes said far more than his words, and the clenching hands
at his sides conveyed a threat that Dan was quick to perceive.
However he felt the other&rsquo;s words he gave no sign.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
And his attitude was once more disconcerting and puzzling
to the furious Jim. He wanted one of those outbursts
of Celtic passion he was used to; he wanted a chance
to hand out unrestrained the fury that was working up
to such a pitch inside him. But the opportunity was not
given. Dan spoke coldly and quietly, a process which
maddened the injured man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words make elegant pictures,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I hate
pictures. See here, Jim Thorpe, you&rsquo;ve ladled it out good
an&rsquo; plenty. Now I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to pass you a dipper o&rsquo; hash.
There&rsquo;s the cattle; there&rsquo;s your brands; there&rsquo;s wher&rsquo; they
was found. Three nuts that need crackin&rsquo;. You guess
you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to crack them nuts. Wal, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s up to
you. Crack &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you needn&rsquo;t to stop here to do
it. You can get right out an&rsquo; do the crackin&rsquo; where you
like. An&rsquo; when you&rsquo;ve cracked &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; you feel like it,&ndash;&ndash;mind,
I don&rsquo;t ask you to&ndash;&ndash;you can come along and you&rsquo;ll
find this shack still standin&rsquo;. That, too, is up to you.
Meanwhiles, Joe Bloc&rsquo;ll slep right here. Guess you&rsquo;ll be
startin&rsquo; out crackin&rsquo; nuts to-morrow morning. There&rsquo;s
just one thing I&rsquo;d like to say before partin&rsquo;, Jim,&rdquo; he
added, his frigidity thawing slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cattleman
first an&rsquo; last. It&rsquo;s meat and drink an&rsquo; pocket-money to
me. My calibre don&rsquo;t cut any figure when there&rsquo;s cattle
stealin&rsquo; doing. As sure as St. Patrick got busy with the
snakes, I&rsquo;d help to hang the last cattle-rustler, an&rsquo; dance
on his face after he was dead&ndash;&ndash;if he was my own brother.
Think o&rsquo; that, and maybe you&rsquo;ll understand things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from the bed and walked out of the hut without
waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>For a full minute Jim stood staring after him through
the doorway. Then his eyes came back to the branding-iron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
on the bed. He stared at it. Then he picked it up
and mechanically examined the stars at the end of it.
Suddenly he flung it out of sight under the bed where it
had come from, and sat on the blankets with his face
resting in his hands.</p>
<p>It was a hideous moment. He was dismissed&ndash;&ndash;under
suspicion. Suddenly he laughed. But the sound that
came was high-pitched, strained, and had no semblance
of a laugh in it. A moment and he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By G&ndash;&ndash;, he can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;he can&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;
he muttered, a new horror in his tone. &ldquo;Sacked&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;fired&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;kicked
out! he&rsquo;s branded me as surely&ndash;&ndash;as surely as
if he&rsquo;d put the irons on me!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>APPROACHING THE TRIBUNAL</h3>
</div>
<p>The sun was mounting royally in the eastern sky.
There was not a breath of air to temper the rapidly heating
atmosphere. The green grassland rolled away on
every hand, a fascinating, limitless plain whose monotony
drives men to deep-throated curses, and yet holds them
to its bosom as surely as might a well-loved mistress. It
was a morning when the heart of man should be stirred
with the joy of life, when lungs expand with deep draughts
of the earth&rsquo;s purest air, when the full, rich blood circulates
with strong, virile pulsations, and the power to do
tingles in every nerve.</p>
<p>It was no day on which a man, branded with the worst
crime known to a cattle country, should set out to face
his fellow men. There should have been darkening
clouds on every horizon. There should have been distant
growlings of thunder, and every now and then the
heavens should have been &ldquo;rent in twain with appalling
floods of cruel light,&rdquo; to match the hopeless gloom of
outraged innocence.</p>
<p>But the glorious summer day was there to mock, as
is the way of things in a world where the struggles and
disasters of humanity must be counted so infinitesimal.</p>
<p>This was the morning when Jim Thorpe turned his
stiffly squared back upon the &ldquo;AZ&rdquo; ranch. He wanted
no melodramatic accompaniment. He wanted the light,
he wanted the cheering sun, he wanted that wealth of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
natural splendor, which the Western prairie can so amply
afford, to lighten the burden which had so suddenly fallen
upon him.</p>
<p>It was another of Fate&rsquo;s little tricks that had been
aimed at him, another side of that unfortunate destiny
which seemed to be ever dogging him. Well might he
have cried out, &ldquo;How long? How long?&rdquo; Whatever
the fates had done for him in the past, whatever his disappointments,
whatever his disasters, crime had found
no place in the accusations against him. It almost
seemed as though his destiny was working its heartless
pranks upon him with ever-growing devilishness.</p>
<p>With subtle foresight, and knowledge of its victim it
timed its efforts carefully, and directed them on a course
that could hurt his spirit most. Even when his inclinations,
his sensibilities were at their highest pitch, down
came the bolt with unerring aim, and surely in the very
direction which, at the moment, could drive him the
hardest, could bow his head the lowest.</p>
<p>Four years in the cattle world had ingrained in him the
instincts of a traffic which possesses a wholesome appeal
to all that is most manly in men. Four years had taught
him to abhor crime against that traffic in a way that was
almost as fanatical as it was in such men as McLagan
and those actually bred to it. He was no exception.
He had caught the fever; and the cattleman&rsquo;s fever is
not easily shaken off. As McLagan would show no
mercy to his own brother were he a proven cattle-thief,
so Jim loathed the crime in little less degree. And he
was about to face the world, his world, branded with that
crime.</p>
<p>It was a terrible thought, a hideous thought, and, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
spite of his squared shoulders, his stiffened back, his
spirit, for the time, was crushed under the burden so unjustly
thrust upon him. He thought of Peter Blunt,
and wondered vaguely what he would say. He wondered
what would be the look in the kindly gray eyes
when he spoke the words of comfort and disbelief which
he knew would await him. That was it. The look. It
was the thought behind the words that mattered&ndash;&ndash;and
could so hurt.</p>
<p>As the miles swept away under his horse&rsquo;s raking
stride, he tried to puzzle out the riddle, or the &ldquo;nut&rdquo;
he had set out to crack, as McLagan had been pleased to
call it. He could see no explanation of it. Why his
brand? He knew well enough that cattle rustlers preferred
to use established brands of distant ranches when it
was necessary to hold stolen cattle in hiding before deporting
them from the district. But <i>his</i> brand. It was
absurd from a rustler&rsquo;s point of view. Everybody knew
his small bunch of cattle. Any excessive number with
his brand on would excite suspicion. It was surely, as he
had said, the work of a prentice hand. No experienced
thief would have done it.</p>
<p>He thought and thought, but he could see no gleam of
light on the matter.</p>
<p>As the miles were covered he still floundered in a maze
of speculation that seemed to lead him nowhither. But
his efforts helped him unconsciously. It kept his mind
from brooding on the disaster to himself, and, to a man of
his sensibilities, this was healthy. He had all the grit to
face his fellow men in self-defense, but, to his proud nature,
it was difficult to stand up under the knowledge of a
disgrace which was not his due.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>He was within a few miles of Barnriff when his mind
suddenly lurched into a fresh channel of thought. With
that roving, groping after a clue to the crime of which he
was morally accused, Eve suddenly grew into his focus.
He thought with a shudder what it would have meant to
her had she married him instead of Will. He tried to
picture her brave face, while she writhed under the taunts
of her sex, and the meaning glances of the men-folk. It
was a terrible picture, and one that brought beads of perspiration
to his brow.</p>
<p>It was a lucky&ndash;&ndash;yes, in spite of Will&rsquo;s defections&ndash;&ndash;thing
for her she had married the man she did. Besides,
Will had mended his ways. He had kept to the judgment
that Peter Blunt had passed on him. Well, he
would have the laugh now.</p>
<p>Then there was Will&rsquo;s success. Everything had gone
his way. Fortune had showered her best on him, whether
he deserved it or not. She apparently found no fault in
him. And they said he was turning out thousands of
dollars. But there, it was no use thinking and wondering.
The luck had all gone Will&rsquo;s way. It was hard&ndash;&ndash;devilish
hard.</p>
<p>Poor Eve! He caught himself pitying her. No, he
had no right to pity her. The pity would have been had
she married him. And yet&ndash;&ndash;perhaps this would never
have happened had she married him. No, he told himself,
it would never, could never have happened then.
For, in the fact of having won her, would not his luck
have been the reverse of what it was?</p>
<p>Suddenly he wondered what she would think when he
told her&ndash;&ndash;or when others told her, as, doubtless by this
time, they had already done. He shuddered. She was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
a cattle country. She was ingrained with all its instincts.
Would she condemn him without a hearing? When he
went to speak to her, would she turn from him as from
something unclean? Again the sweat broke out at his
thought. She might. The facts were deadly against
him. And yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet somehow&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; No, he dared
not speculate; he must wait.</p>
<p>There was the humble little village on ahead of him,
nestling like some tiny boat amidst the vast rollers of the
prairie ocean. There, ahead, were his judges, and amongst
them the woman who was still more to him than his very
life. He must face them, face them all. And when their
verdict was pronounced, as he knew it would be in no uncertain
manner, then, with girded loins, he must stand
out, and, conscious of his innocence, fight the great battle.
It was the world&ndash;&ndash;his world&ndash;&ndash;against him, he knew.
What&ndash;&ndash;what must be the result?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
</div>
<p>Half an hour later Jim rode into Barnriff. It was getting
on toward noon, and most of the villagers were busy
at their various occupations. As he rode on to the market-place
he glanced quickly about him, and, all unconsciously,
there was defiance and resentment in his dark
eyes; the look of a man prepared for the accusations which
he knew were awaiting him. But this attitude was quite
wasted, for there were few people about, and those few
were either too far off, or too busy to note his coming, or
appreciate his feelings, as expressed in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>It is strange how instinct will so often take the lead in
moments critical in the lives of human beings. Jim had
no thought of whither his immediate destination lay, yet
he was riding straight for the house of the friendly gold
prospector. Doubtless his action was due to a subconscious
realization of a friendliness and trust on the part of
Peter, which was not to be overborne by the first breath
of suspicion.</p>
<p>He was within fifty yards of that friendly, open door,
when he became aware that a woman&rsquo;s figure was standing
before it. Her back was turned, and she looked to be
either peering within the hut, or talking to some one inside
it. Nor, strangely enough, did he recognize the trim
outline of her figure until she abruptly turned away and
moved off in the direction of her own house. It was Eve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Henderson. And, without hesitation, he swung his horse
in her direction.</p>
<p>She saw him at once and, smiling a welcome, waited
for him to come up. He saw the smile and the unhesitating
way she stepped forward to greet him. There could
have been no doubt of her cordiality, even eagerness, yet
with the shadow of his disgrace hanging over him, he
tried to look beyond it for that something which he was
ready to resent even in her.</p>
<p>He saw the shadow on her face, which even her smile
had no power to lift out of its troubled lines. He saw
dark shadows round her eyes, the tremulous, drooping
mouth, once so buoyant and happy, and he selfishly took
these signs to himself, and moodily felt that she was trying
vainly to conceal her real thoughts of him behind a
display of loyalty.</p>
<p>There was no verbal greeting between them, and he
felt this to be a further ominous sign. Somehow, he
could not force himself to an ordinary greeting under
the circumstances. She had doubtless heard the story,
so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But he was quite wrong. Eve was simply
wondering at his coming. Wondering what it portended.
She had truly enough heard the story of the
recovery of the cattle, as who in Barnriff had not? But
her wonder and nervousness were not for him, but for
herself. It was for herself, and had to do with that fear
she had told Annie Gay of, and which now had become
a sort of waking nightmare to her.</p>
<p>Jim sprang from the saddle. Linking his arm through
the reins, he stood facing the woman he loved.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, in a curious, half-defiant manner,
while his glance swept over every detail of her pretty,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
troubled face. Finally it settled upon the slight scar over
her temple, and a less selfish feeling took possession of
him. The change in her expression suddenly told him
its own story. Her eyes were the eyes of suffering, not
of any condemnation of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve just been over to see if Peter was in,&rdquo; she
said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter? Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;and, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was suddenly seized with a feeling of awkwardness
such as he had never before felt when talking to Eve.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and began to move in the
direction of her house. He fell in beside her, and, for a
moment, neither spoke. Finally she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said regretfully. &ldquo;And I sure wanted to
see him so badly. You see,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;Elia is
away. He&rsquo;s been away for days, and, well, I want to
know where he is. I get so anxious when he&rsquo;s away.
You see, he&rsquo;s so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Peter know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At least I&rsquo;m hoping so. Elia goes with him a
deal now, on his expeditions. Peter&rsquo;s real good to him.
I think he&rsquo;s trying to help him in&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;you know Elia
is so&ndash;&ndash;so delicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s evident reluctance to put into words her well-loved
brother&rsquo;s weaknesses roused all Jim&rsquo;s sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. And is he supposed to be with Peter
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went away with him four days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was another awkward pause. Again Eve
was the one to break it. They were nearing the gate of
her little garden.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But what has brought you into town, Jim?&rdquo; she
suddenly asked, as though his presence had only just occurred
to her as being unusual.</p>
<p>With a rush the memory of all his disgrace came upon
him again. He laughed bitterly, harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of Dame Fortune&rsquo;s kicks,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;ah, I forgot. Of course. Well, we&rsquo;ll call it <i>one</i>
of Dame Fortune&rsquo;s kicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the&ndash;&ndash;cattle stealing?&rdquo; She was staring
straight ahead of her, and into her eyes had leaped a
sudden look of fear which she dared not let him see.</p>
<p>But Jim was too busy with himself to even notice her
hesitation. He had no room to realize her emotions just
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, almost viciously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that&ndash;&ndash;I
s&rsquo;pose I ought to say &lsquo;because&rsquo; of that.&rdquo; She glanced
at him swiftly, but waited for him to go on. He did so
with another nervous laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fired,&rsquo; Eve. Kicked
out by Dan McLagan, and branded by him as a suspected
cattle-thief, as surely&ndash;&ndash;as surely as they&rsquo;ve found a bunch
of his cattle branded with my brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the gate, and Eve turned facing
him. There was a curious look in her eyes. It was
almost one of relief. Yet it was not quite. There was
something else in it. There was incredulity, resentment;
something which suggested a whole world of trust and
confidence in the man before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you accused of cattle
stealing? You? He must be mad. They must all be
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>The girl suddenly flushed. She had said more than
she intended. But there was no use drawing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she cried hotly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to let you
know. I&rsquo;ve heard the story. Of course I have. Who,
living in such a place as Barnriff, wouldn&rsquo;t hear it?&rdquo; she
hurried on bitterly. &ldquo;Directly they told me I laughed at
them. But&ndash;&ndash;but they do suspect you. Oh, Jim, I think
I hate these folks. You&ndash;&ndash;you suspected of cattle-duffing.
McLagan ought to be ashamed of himself. It&rsquo;s cruel in
such a country as this. And the evidence is so ridiculous.
Oh, Jim, if it weren&rsquo;t so horrible it would be
almost&ndash;&ndash;almost laughable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Eve. And that&ndash;&ndash;is really what you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked him in the face with wide, wondering eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled ever so slightly. He felt better. A
few more loyal friends like this and his position would
be considerably easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are all branded with my
&lsquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
he went on doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of it? It&rsquo;s a blind. It&rsquo;s to put folks off
the real track. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She broke off, and her eyelids
were suddenly lowered to hide the fear with which her
own words again inspired her. As she did not continue
Jim seized his opportunity to pour out something of what
he felt at her unquestioning loyalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he cried, his eyes lighting with the love he was
powerless to keep altogether under. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what
all your words mean to me. You don&rsquo;t know how glad
they make me feel. Do you know, when I was riding
up to you just now I was looking for a sign of suspicion
in your eyes? If I&rsquo;d seen it&ndash;&ndash;if I&rsquo;d seen it, I can&rsquo;t tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
you what it would have meant to me. I almost thought
I did see it, but now I know I was wrong. There&rsquo;s just
about two folks for whose opinion I care in this village,
you and Peter. Well, now I feel I can face the rest.
For the present I&rsquo;m an unconvicted cattle rustler to them.
There&rsquo;s not much difference between that and a rawhide
rope with them. But there&rsquo;s just a bit of difference, and
to that bit I&rsquo;m going to hold good and tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s face suddenly went an ashy gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jim, they&rsquo;d never&ndash;&ndash;never hang you.&rdquo; Her
voice was low. There was a thrill of horror in it which
made the man&rsquo;s heart glow. He felt that her horror was
for his safety, and not for the fact of the hanging. Then
the feeling swiftly passed. He remembered in time that
she was the wife of another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would,&rdquo; he said decidedly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d hang me,
or anybody else, with very little more proof than they&rsquo;ve
already got. You don&rsquo;t realize what cattle-duffing means
to these folks. It&rsquo;s worse than murder. But,&rdquo; he went
on, struggling to lighten his manner, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not going
to hang me, if I know it. It&rsquo;s up to me to run this
rustler to earth. I&rsquo;m going to. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m out for.
After I&rsquo;d made up my mind to hunt the devil down McLagan
informed me, not in so many words, of course,
that to do so was the only way to convince folks of my
innocence&ndash;&ndash;himself included. So I&rsquo;m going to hunt him
down, if it takes months, and costs me my last cent.
And when I find him&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;his eyes lit with a terrible
purpose&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;may God have mercy on his soul, for I
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl had no response for him. Her enthusiastic
belief in his innocence found no further expression.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
When he pronounced his determination her eyes were
wide and staring, and as he ceased speaking she turned
them toward the distant hills, lest he should witness the
terror she could no longer hide. A shudder passed over
her slight figure. She was struggling with herself, with
that haunting fear that was ever dogging her. The
thought of the rawhide rope had set it shuddering
through her nerve centres afresh in a way that bathed
her in a cold perspiration.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood battling thus. Then, in the
midst of the struggle something came upon her, and her
heart seemed to stand still. It was as though a flash of
mental light had illumined her clouded horizon. Realization
swept in upon her, a full terrible realization of the
source of her fear.</p>
<p>It was to do with this cattle stealing. Yes, she knew
it now. She knew more. She knew who the cattle-rustler
was, for whom Jim was to stand the blame. She
needed no words to tell her. She had no evidence. She
needed none. Her woman&rsquo;s instinct served her, as
though she had witnessed his acts. It was Will. It was&ndash;&ndash;her
husband.</p>
<p>And, all unconsciously, for so long this had been her
fear. She remembered now so many things. She remembered
his cynical laugh when he told her of his gold
find, and how easy it was to work. She remembered her
lack of confidence in his story&ndash;&ndash;knowing the man as she
did. She remembered her repugnance at the sight of the
money he had spent on her, and how she could never
bring herself to touch that which he sent to her. She
had believed then that her reasons were personal. That
it was because it came from him, the man who had struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
her down, and left her to die at his hands, for all he
cared; the man whose brutality had so quickly killed her
love; the man whom she had long since admitted to herself
that she detested, despised. No, she needed no
further evidence. It was her woman&rsquo;s instinct that
guided and convinced her.</p>
<p>She shuddered. She was chilled under a blazing sun
that had no power to warm her. But her terror was not
for Will. It was for herself. For the hideousness of the
disgrace to which he had brought her. In fancy she saw
him food for carrion at the end of a rope; she saw his
body swaying to the night breeze, an ominous, hideous
shadow, a warning to all of the fate awaiting those who
sinned against the unwritten laws of the cattle world.
She heard the pitying tones of the village women, she
saw their furtive side glances, heard their whispering
comments as they passed her, these women whom she
had always lived amongst, whom she had always counted
as friends. Oh, the horror of it all, and she was utterly&ndash;&ndash;utterly
powerless. Worse, she must strive her utmost
to shield Will. And, because he was her husband, she
must leave Jim to fight his own battle with her added
wits pitted against him.</p>
<p>She remembered Jim&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;May God have mercy
on his soul, for I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Jim&ndash;&ndash;Jim was to be Will&rsquo;s
Nemesis&ndash;&ndash;her Nemesis. He must be the man who
would drive the sword crashing her to the dust beneath
the weight of her husband&rsquo;s crime.</p>
<p>A despairing hope swept her. Ah, no, no. It could
not be. That would be too cruel. No, no, she must be
wrong. Will was not guilty. He could not be. This
thing could surely never come upon her. What had she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
ever done to deserve it? What&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;? She thought of
the man before her. What had he ever done to deserve
his fate? And suddenly the momentary hope slid from
under her feet.</p>
<p>Now her thought and terror found expression against
her will. It would not be denied. It showed in her
shrinking attitude. It was displayed in her horrified
eyes. And Jim saw these things and read them in his
own way. He deemed that he had shocked her by his
words, nor could he clearly understand that the force of
his determination to defend himself should so shock her.
However, he promptly strove to lighten the impression
he had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us speak of these things. Let us think and
speak of other matters. You see,&rdquo; he went on whimsically,
&ldquo;you were the first person I met, and I s&rsquo;pose it
was only natural you should get all the burden of&ndash;&ndash;of
my nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve could not rid herself of her terror. She felt
she must talk of this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with an effort to keep calm, &ldquo;we must
talk of it. We must think&ndash;&ndash;think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need for you to think, Eve. Put it out
of your head. I shall run him to earth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jim,&rdquo; she broke out, his words driving her to
fresh terror, &ldquo;it must be some half-breeds. Or&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;some
&lsquo;toughs&rsquo; from across the border. It must be. We
are very near the Canadian border, remember. They&rsquo;re
always being driven across by the Mounted Police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s some one in the locality. Some one nobody
would suspect. You see, there have been no strangers
in the district for months.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Eve&rsquo;s startled inquiry came
almost defiantly.</p>
<p>If the man noticed her tone he gave no sign. He
shook his head decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had the district hunted, scoured thoroughly,
sure.&rdquo; Then he shrugged. &ldquo;But it don&rsquo;t matter. Psha!
I&rsquo;d sooner it was some half-breed or tough. I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d be
less sorry for him.&rdquo; He paused and gazed tenderly into
her troubled face. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t need to be so shocked.
Why?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;This thing can&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl jumped at the chance of denial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; she exclaimed eagerly.
Then, with a pitiful effort at subterfuge, &ldquo;But you, Jim.
To think that you are blamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant his love was uppermost again. Her
distress, whatever its cause, appealed to all that was best
and manliest in him. Just now he took it to himself.
And, in consequence, he found it hard to keep himself
within the bounds of restraint. She was so sweet, so
desirable in the pathetic picture she made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you worry, Eve,&rdquo; he said, with infinite gentleness.
&ldquo;This is up to me, and&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to see it
through. But here, I&rsquo;m so full of my own troubles I&rsquo;m
forgetting all the good things coming your way. Say,
I&rsquo;m mighty glad of your luck. Will&rsquo;s claim is a bonanza,
I&rsquo;m told. I hear wonderful accounts of it&ndash;&ndash;and
of him.&rdquo; Then his voice lowered and his calm eyes
darkened. &ldquo;He has straightened up, hasn&rsquo;t he? It&rsquo;s a
great thing. You&rsquo;ll be happier&ndash;&ndash;now. You&ndash;&ndash;you
won&rsquo;t need my help&ndash;&ndash;I mean for him. They tell me
he&rsquo;s hit the right trail, and is busy traveling it.&rdquo; He
sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, real glad&ndash;&ndash;for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>But curiously enough his sympathy met with no
response. On the contrary, Eve seemed to freeze up.
Every word he uttered lashed her until she felt she
must blurt out to him the thing she believed to be the
truth. But even in her agony of heart and mind she
remembered what she conceived to be her duty, and, in
self-defense, assumed a cold unresponsiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he&rsquo;ll be a way up millionaire,&rdquo; Jim went
on, so busy with his own thoughts that he did not notice
her silence. &ldquo;Gee, and so easy, too. It&rsquo;s queer how
fortune runs. Some folks work like&ndash;&ndash;like Dagos, and
get&ndash;&ndash;mud. Others have gold poured over &rsquo;em, whether
they work or not. But he must have worked to find it.
Yes, sure. And having found it you can&rsquo;t blame him
for not letting folks into the secret&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve had not spoken. It was only a look, and an
inarticulate sound. But it was a look of such abject terror
that it could no longer escape the man&rsquo;s thoughtful
eyes. Eve had betrayed herself in her very dread lest
he should suspect. His reference to Will&rsquo;s secret had
suggested suspicion to her, and the rest was the result
of her innate honesty and simplicity.</p>
<p>Jim stared at her. And slowly a curious look crept
into his eyes. Her terror was so evident, and&ndash;&ndash;he
thought back over the words that had inspired it. He
was talking of Will&ndash;&ndash;of Will&rsquo;s secret. For the moment
he stood dumbfounded at that which flashed through his
mind. Then he turned slowly, and mechanically threw
the reins over his horse&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>When he looked round again Eve was still staring at
him. Her terror was, if possible, intensified. Suddenly
a great pity for her rose up in his heart. All his love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
was stirred to the almost limitless depths of his big
heart. How he loved this woman! How he longed to
take her to his heart, and shelter her from all the cruel
buffeting of a harsh life! How he would fight for her,
strive for her, work for her&ndash;&ndash;and now? He thought of
the brand that had fallen upon him, and he thought of
that something which her sudden terrified glance had
stirred in his unsuspicious mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll get on to the saloon, as Peter isn&rsquo;t in his
hut,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet, unmeaning tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if
I can locate Elia for you.&rdquo; He paused, and then swung
into the saddle. Glancing down at her, he leaned forward
and spoke earnestly. &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it still
stands good: the old order. When you need me&ndash;&ndash;for
anything, mind&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve only got to send me word.
Wherever I am I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; He straightened up. He
saw the girl make an effort to swallow, and glanced
away to give her a chance to recover her composure.
As he did so he saw a number of women and some
men scattered about at the doorways of various houses.
He promptly turned to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he cried, with a slightly forced laugh. &ldquo;The
vultures are around. They&rsquo;re looking for scandal, and,
by the signs, I&rsquo;d say they guess they&rsquo;ve found it. To
a man&ndash;&ndash;or woman&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re staring this way. Say, I&rsquo;ll
get going. Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;and don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode off. Eve had not spoken. She knew that
he knew, and she was overwhelmed at the knowledge.
She slowly turned to the house, and with weary steps
passed up the narrow pathway.</p>
<p>And Jim? The moment his face was turned from
her his smile died out, leaving it stern and hard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE</h3>
</div>
<p>Silas Rocket&rsquo;s saloon was more than usually desirable
just now. There was so much news of an exciting
nature going about. Of course, fertile invention was
brought to bear in its purveyance, but that only made
it the more exciting.</p>
<p>On the morning that brought Jim Thorpe into Barnriff
many of the men of the village were partaking of a
general hash up of the overnight dish of news, to which
was added the delectable condiment of Jim&rsquo;s sudden
advent in their midst. From the windows of the saloon
his movements were closely watched, as, also, were they
from many of the village houses. Speculation was rife.
Curious eyes and bitter thoughts were in full play, while
his meeting with Eve Henderson was sufficiently significant
to the scandalous minds of the more virtuous
women and the coarser men.</p>
<p>The saloon rang with a discordant blending of curses
aimed at the head of the unconscious visitor, and ribald
jests at the expense of the absent gold discoverer.</p>
<p>For the moment Anthony Smallbones had the floor.
It was a position he never failed to enjoy. He loved
publicity. And, in his secret mind, he firmly believed
that, but for the presence of Doc Crombie in the village,
he would undoubtedly have held place and power,
and have been dictating the destiny of the village.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Thus it was that, just now, a considerable measure of
his spleen was aimed at the absent doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear as day. That&rsquo;s sure. Doc Crombie&rsquo;s
hangin&rsquo; back,&rdquo; he was saying, in his curiously mean,
high-pitched voice. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for me to say he ain&rsquo;t got
grit. No, folks. But it&rsquo;s easy to guess for why he hangs
back.&rdquo; He blinked truculently into the faces gathered
about him, mutely daring anybody else to state that
reason. But few cared to discuss the redoubtable doctor,
so he was permitted to continue. &ldquo;Doc&rsquo;s a sight too
friendly disposed toward sech a skunk as Jim Thorpe.
We&rsquo;ve clear enough proof that feller is a cattle-rustler.
We&rsquo;ve the evidence of our eyes, sure. There&rsquo;s the cattle;
ther&rsquo;s his brand&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;running with his own stock,
hidden away up in the foot-hills. Do we need more?
Psha! No. At least no one with any savvee. I&rsquo;ve
see fellers strung up on less evidence than that, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
bin on the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rope?&rdquo; inquired Gay, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the rope, mister. Not the rope, but the
committee as condemned &rsquo;em,&rdquo; retorted Smallbones,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuss!&rdquo; exclaimed the baker with profound contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; snarled the little man with an evil upward
glance at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest this,&rdquo; cried Wilkes with heat. &ldquo;The feller that
hangs his feller man on slim evidence is a lousy, yaller
skunk. Say he&rsquo;d orter hev his belly tarred, an&rsquo; a sky-rocket
turned loose in his vitals. I sez right here the
evidence against Jim ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;nuff to condemn a gopher.
It&rsquo;s positive ridiculous. Wot needs provin&rsquo; is, who set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
that brand on McLagan&rsquo;s cattle? That&rsquo;s the question
I&rsquo;m astin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psha! You make me sick!&rdquo; cried Smallbones, his
ferret-eyes dancing with rage. &ldquo;Put your question. An&rsquo;
when you put it, who&rsquo;s got to get busy answerin&rsquo;? I tell
you it&rsquo;s up to Jim Thorpe to prove he didn&rsquo;t brand &rsquo;em.
If he can&rsquo;t do that satisfact&rsquo;ry, then he&rsquo;s got to swing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had a divided audience. Gay shook his head,
and two others audibly disagreed with his methods. But,
in spite of this, the weight of opinion against Jim might
easily have been carried had not the carpenter suddenly
swept the last chance clear from under Smallbones&rsquo; feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; cried the furious Jake, with such swift heat
that even those who knew him best were staggered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
sooner call a cattle-rustler friend than claim friendship,
with such a low-down bum as Anthony Smallbones.
Say, you scrap-iron niggler,&rdquo; he cried, advancing threateningly
upon his victim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something that
ain&rsquo;t likely leaked in that sieve head o&rsquo; yours. Cattle-rustlers
is mostly men. Mebbe they&rsquo;re low-down,
murderin&rsquo; pirates, but they&rsquo;re men&ndash;&ndash;as us folks understands
men. They ain&rsquo;t allus skunkin&rsquo; behind Bible
trac&rsquo;s &rsquo;cos they&rsquo;re scairt to git out in the open. They&rsquo;re
allus ready to put up a gamble, with their lives for the
pot. An&rsquo; when they gits it I guess they&rsquo;re sure ready to
take their med&rsquo;cine wi&rsquo;out squealin&rsquo;. Which needs grit
an&rsquo; nerve. Two things I don&rsquo;t guess Anthony Smallbones
has ever heerd tell of outside a dime fiction. No,
sir, I guess you got a foul, psalm-singin&rsquo; tongue, but you
ain&rsquo;t got no grit. Say,&rdquo; he added witheringly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate
to see such a miser&rsquo;ble spectacle as you goin&rsquo; to a man&rsquo;s
death. I&rsquo;d git sick feelin&rsquo; sore I belonged to the human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
race. Nope, you couldn&rsquo;t never be a man. Say, you
ain&rsquo;t even a&ndash;&ndash;louse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laugh that followed ruined Smallbones&rsquo; last chance
of influencing the public mind. He spluttered and
shouted furiously, but no one would listen. And, in the
midst of his discomfiture, a diversion was created by the
entrance of a small man with a round, cheery face and
bad feet. He was a freighter. He walked to the bar,
called for a drink, and inquired where Mrs. Henderson
lived. It was his inquiry that made him the centre of
interest at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Henderson?&rdquo; said Silas, as he set the whiskey
before his customer. &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s her shanty yonder.&rdquo;
And he pointed through the window nearest him.
&ldquo;Freight?&rdquo; he inquired casually, after the little man had
taken his bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Harmonium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rocket&rsquo;s astonishment was reflected in all the faces now
crowding round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Then the freighter perceived the interest he
had created, and promptly became expansive. &ldquo;From
the &AElig;olian Musical Corporation, Highfield, Californy.
To order of William Henderson, shipped to wife of
same, Barnriff, Montana. Kind o&rsquo; musical around these
parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; on&ndash;&ndash;comin&rsquo; on nicely,&rdquo; observed
Silas, winking at his friends gathered round.</p>
<p>Gay nodded, and proceeded to support him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;see, most of our leddies has got higher than &rsquo;cordions
an&rsquo; sech things. Though I &rsquo;lows a concertina takes
a beatin&rsquo;. Still, education has got loose on Barnriff, an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
I heerd tell as ther&rsquo;s some o&rsquo; the folks yearnin&rsquo; fer piannys.
I did hear one of our leadin&rsquo; citizens, Mr. Anthony Smallbones,
was about to finance a brass band layout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo; to beat a slap-up band,&rdquo; agreed the
freighter politely. &ldquo;But these yer harmoniums, they&rsquo;re
kind o&rsquo; cussed, some. Guess my ma had one some years
back, but she traded it off fer a new cook-stove, with a line
o&rsquo; Chicago bacon thrown in. I won&rsquo;t say but she had
the best o&rsquo; the deal, too. Y&rsquo;see that ther&rsquo; harmonium
had its drawbacks. You never could gamble if it had a
cold in the head or a mortal pain in its vitals. It wus
kind o&rsquo; passionate in some of its keys, and wep&rsquo; an&rsquo;
sniveled like a spanked kid in others. Then it would
yep like a hound if you happened to push the wrong
button, an&rsquo; groan to beat the band if you didn&rsquo;t. Nope.
They&rsquo;re cur&rsquo;us things if they ain&rsquo;t treat right, an&rsquo; I guess
my ma hadn&rsquo;t got the knack o&rsquo; pullin&rsquo; them bolts right.
Y&rsquo;see she&rsquo;d been trained hoein&rsquo; kebbeges on a farm in
her early years, an&rsquo; I guess ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; more
calc&rsquo;lated to fix a woman queer fer the doin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; perlite
sassiety than hoein&rsquo; kebbeges. Guess I&rsquo;ll get right on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid for his drink, and, followed by the whole company,
hobbled out to his wagon. He was a queer figure,
but, at the moment, his defects were forgotten in the
interest created by his mission to Barnriff.</p>
<p>What prosperity the possession of a harmonium suggested
to those men might have been judged by the attitude
they took up the moment they were outside. They
crowded round the wagon and gazed at the baize-covered
instrument, caged within its protecting crate.
They reached out and felt it through the baize; they
peeked in through the gaping covering, and a hushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
awe prevailed, until, with a cheery wave of the hand, the
teamster drove off in the direction of Eve&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Then the chorus of comment broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Wilkes. &ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a harmonium!&rdquo;
Then, overpowered by his emotion, he remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psha! Makes me sick!&rdquo; cried Smallbones. &ldquo;My
sister in Iowa has got a fiddle; an&rsquo; I know she plays five
toons on it&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve heerd her. She&rsquo;s got a mouth organ,
too, an&rsquo; a musical-box&ndash;&ndash;electric! One &rsquo;ud think nobody
had got nuthin&rsquo; but Will Henderson.&rdquo; He strode back
to the bar in dudgeon, filled to the brim with malicious
envy.</p>
<p>Others took quite a different tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s walnut,&rdquo; said Restless, his professional instincts
fully alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; agreed Gay, &ldquo;burr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s got pipes,&rdquo; cried Rust, impressively. &ldquo;I see
&rsquo;em sure, stickin&rsquo; up under its wrappin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely imitation,&rdquo; suggested Gay, with commercial
wisdom. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;see them things needs fakin&rsquo; up to
please the eye. If they please the eye, they ain&rsquo;t like to
hit the ear-drums so bad. Wimmin is cur&rsquo;us that aways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; agreed Rust, bowing to the butcher&rsquo;s superior
knowledge. &ldquo;But I guess it must &rsquo;a&rsquo; cost a heap
o&rsquo; dollars. Say, Will must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got it rich. I&rsquo;d like to
savvee wher&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added, with a sigh, as they thoughtfully
returned to the bar.</p>
<p>But nobody paid any attention to the blacksmith&rsquo;s regrets.
They were all too busy with their own. There
was not a man amongst them but had been duly impressed
by the arrival of the harmonium. Gay, who was
prosperous, felt that a musical instrument was not altogether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
beyond his means. In fact, then and there he
got the idea of his wife learning to play a couple of
funeral hymns, so he&rsquo;d be able to charge more for interments,
and, at the same time, make them more artistic.</p>
<p>Restless, too, was mildly envious. But being a carpenter,
he got no further in his admiration of Will&rsquo;s
wealth than the fact that he could decorate his home
with burr walnut. He had always believed he had done
well for himself in possessing a second-hand mahogany
bureau, and an ash bedstead, but, after all, these were
mere necessities, and their glory faded before burr walnut.</p>
<p>Rust, being a mere blacksmith, considered the wood
but little, while the pipes fairly dazzled him. Henderson
with a pipe organ! That was the wonder. He had only
the vaguest notion of the cost, but, somewhere in the
back of his head, he had a shadowy idea that such things
ran into thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>A sort of depression crowded down the bar-room after
the arrival of the harmonium. Nobody seemed inclined
to drink, and talk was somehow impossible. Nor was it
until Smallbones suddenly started, and gleefully pointed
at the window, and informed the company that Jim
Thorpe and Eve had parted at last at the gate of her
cabbage patch, and that he was coming across to the
saloon, that the gloom vanished, and a rapidly rising excitement
took its place. All eyes were at once turned
upon the window, and Smallbones again tasted the sweets
of public prominence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; right here. The nerve
of it. I &rsquo;lows it&rsquo;s up to us to get busy. I say he&rsquo;s a
cattle-thief, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>But Jake turned on him furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your ugly face,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or&ndash;&ndash;or I&rsquo;ll break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baker&rsquo;s threat was effective. Smallbones relapsed
into moody silence, his beady eyes watching with the
others the coming of the horseman. As Jim drew near
they backed from the window. But they lost nothing of
his movements. They watched him hitch his horse to
the tying-post. They watched him thoughtfully loosen
his cinchas. They saw that he had a roll of blankets at
the cantle of his saddle, and saddle-bags at its sides.
They saw, also, that he was armed liberally. A pair of
guns on his saddle, and one attached to the cartridge
belt about his hips. Each mind was speculating, and
each mind was puzzled at the man&rsquo;s apparent unconcern.</p>
<p>A moment later the swing doors parted, and Jim
strode in. His dark eyes flashed a swift glance about
the dingy interior. He noted the familiar faces, and
very evident attitudes of unconcern. He knew at once
that his coming had been witnessed, and that, in all
probability, he had been well discussed. He was in no
mood to mince matters, and intended to test the public
feeling at once. With a cheery &ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; which included
everybody, he walked to the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll all drink, Silas,&rdquo; he said cheerily, and laid
a five-dollar bill on the counter.</p>
<p>But, for once in his life, the saloon-keeper felt it would
be necessary to ask his customers what they would drink.
This he did, while Jim turned to Jake and the butcher,
who happened to be standing nearest to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quit the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, with a light laugh.
&ldquo;Or p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I&rsquo;d best say McLagan&rsquo;s quit me. Say, I&rsquo;m
out on the war-path, chasing cattle-rustlers,&rdquo; he went on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
with a smile. &ldquo;That bunch of cattle coming in with my
brand on &rsquo;em has set my name stinking some with Mac,
and I guess it&rsquo;s up to me to&ndash;&ndash;disinfect it. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His final ejaculation was made at Rocket. There were
three glasses set out on the counter, and the saloon-keeper
was handing him his change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three drinks,&rdquo; that worthy was explaining. &ldquo;The
rest o&rsquo; the boys don&rsquo;t guess they&rsquo;re thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim stiffened his back, and coldly glanced over the
faces about him. He counted ten men, without including
himself and Rocket. Of these, only two, Jake and
Gay, had accepted his invitation. Suddenly his eyes
rested on the triumphant face of Smallbones. Without
a word he strode across the room, and his hand fell
heavily on the man&rsquo;s quaking shoulder. In a moment
he had dragged him to the centre of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll do, Smallbones,&rdquo; he began, as he released
the man&rsquo;s coat collar. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t move. You&rsquo;re
going to stand right there and hand me out the story I
see dodging behind those wicked eyes of yours. You&rsquo;ve
got it there, good and plenty, back of them, so get going,
and&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll all listen. Whatever I&rsquo;ve got to say
you&rsquo;ll get after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones&rsquo; eyes snapped fire. He was furious at the
rough handling, and he longed more than ever to hurt
this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a strong man, an bein&rsquo; strong, you&rsquo;re mighty
free with your hands,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re up agin
it. Up agin it bad, Jim Thorpe.&rdquo; His face lit with a
grin of venom. &ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t need no story from me.
You&rsquo;ll get it plenty from&ndash;&ndash;everywhere! McLagan&rsquo;s quit
you, because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Wal, I&rsquo;m a law-abidin&rsquo; citizen, an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
don&rsquo;t figger to drink with folks suspected of&ndash;&ndash;cattle-rustlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones&rsquo; challenge held the whole room silent.
Jake, watching and listening, was astonished at the man&rsquo;s
moral courage. But the chief interest was in the ex-ranch-foreman.
What would he do?</p>
<p>The question was swiftly answered. Jim&rsquo;s head went
up, and a light laugh prefaced his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m up against it?&rdquo; he said calmly. Then he
gazed contemptuously round on those who had rejected
his hospitality. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why all you fellows refused to
drink with me. Well, it&rsquo;s a nasty pill, and it&rsquo;s likely to
hand me indigestion.&rdquo; Then he deliberately turned his
back on Smallbones and glanced at the counter. The
drinks he had bought were still there. He looked up
with a frank smile into the faces of the two men who
were willing to drink with him. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it seems to me there are just two drinks between
me and&ndash;&ndash;the rope. Will you honor a suspected man
by clinking glasses with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his own glass to them, and Jake and Gay
nearly fell over each other in their frantic efforts to express
their willingness, and their disapproval of Smallbones.
They clumsily clinked their glasses, and drank to
the last drop. Then, in silence, they set their glasses
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jake. Thanks, Gay,&rdquo; said Jim, after a
moment. Then he turned to the saloon-keeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry the order&rsquo;s so small,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make it one bigger,&rdquo; grinned Silas, and
Promptly held out his hand.</p>
<p>The two men gripped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; murmured Jim. And at the same instant
Smallbones&rsquo; offensive voice broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real elegant scene,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Most touchin&rsquo;.
Sort o&rsquo; mothers&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;.&rdquo; But in a second his tone
changed to a furious rasp. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you mistake, Jim
Thorpe; three drinks ain&rsquo;t buyin&rsquo; you clear. If you&rsquo;re
the honest man you say, you&rsquo;ll hev to prove it. There&rsquo;s
the cattle with your brand on &rsquo;em. Whose hand set it on?
Who keeps that brand? Who runs his stock in hidin&rsquo; up
in the hills? Them&rsquo;s the questions we&rsquo;re all astin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
up to you to answer &rsquo;em right. Ef you don&rsquo;t, then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
he finished with a suggestive motion of hanging.</p>
<p>But Jim had had enough. A moment of blind fury
seized upon him, and he swung round on his accuser.
The heavy rawhide quirt hanging on his wrist was raised
aloft threateningly, and his eyes were the eyes of a man
at the limit of endurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word from you and I&rsquo;ll flay you alive with
this quirt,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your say, and now, I
guess, I&rsquo;ll have mine. You know just as much as all the
rest of the folk here; no more and no less. No more
and no less than I do. When you or anybody else gets
definite proof that I&rsquo;m a cattle-thief you are at liberty to
talk, but, until then, if I hear you, or of you, publicly
charging me with cattle stealing, I&rsquo;ll smash you, if I swing
for it. Get right out, now. Get right out, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones stood for a moment glaring at the threatening
man. His teeth were bared in a tigerish grin. He
was the picture of ferocity, but, as Jim took a step toward
him, his dark face white with passion, he dropped back
and finally made for the door.</p>
<p>But the turn of fortune&rsquo;s wheel was still against Jim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
For Smallbones, the situation was saved by the advent of
Doc Crombie. That redoubtable man pushed his way in
through the swing doors and promptly hailed him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Smallbones,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word for you
fellows. How many are there here?&rdquo; He glanced
round the bar swiftly, and finally his eyes rested on Jim
Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He paused, while he mentally estimated the
prevailing feeling. Then he addressed himself to Silas
behind the bar. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help the boys to drinks,&rdquo; he
said. Then, pointedly, &ldquo;All of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; After that, he
turned to Jim. &ldquo;Jest in from the &lsquo;AZ&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo; he inquired
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McLagan&rsquo;s quit me on account of those cattle,&rdquo; Jim
admitted, frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those wi&rsquo; your brand on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc smiled. He could not well have failed to become
the leader of this village. Power was written in every
line of his hard, shrewd face.</p>
<p>The moment the drinks had been served and heartily
consumed, he addressed himself to the company generally.
And, at his first words, Smallbones flashed a wicked look
of triumph into the face of Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this cattle-rustlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, coming to the point
at once. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to quit, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s right up to us to see it
does quit. I ain&rsquo;t come here like a politician, nor a sky-pilot
to talk the rights an&rsquo; wrongs of things. It&rsquo;s not in
my line ladlin&rsquo; out psalms an&rsquo; things. Ther&rsquo;s folks paid
fer that sort o&rsquo; hogwash. It&rsquo;s jest been decided to run a
gang o&rsquo; vigilantes over this district, an&rsquo; every feller called
upon&rsquo;s expected to roll up prompt. I&rsquo;ve been around an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
located twelve of the boys from the ranges. I want eight
more. With me it&rsquo;ll make twenty-one. Smallbones,&rdquo;
he proceeded, turning on the hardware merchant with an
authority that would not be denied, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make one.
You two fellers, Jake, an&rsquo; you, carpenter&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s three.
You, Rust&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s four. Long Pete an&rsquo; you, Sam Purdy,
an&rsquo; Crook Wilson; you three ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; a heap hangin&rsquo;
around this bum canteen&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s seven.&rdquo; His eyes suddenly
sought Jim&rsquo;s, and a cold command fell upon his
victim even before his words came. &ldquo;Guess, under the
circ&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he remarked pointedly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d best make the
eighth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim shook his head. A light of determination, as
keen as the doctor&rsquo;s own, shone in the smiling eyes that
confronted the man of authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for mine, Doc,&rdquo; he said deliberately. &ldquo;Not on
your life. Here, I don&rsquo;t want any mistake,&rdquo; he hastened
on, as he watched the anger leap into the other&rsquo;s face,
and beheld the sparkle of malice lighting the beady eyes
of Smallbones. &ldquo;Just listen to me. If you&rsquo;ll take a look
around you&rsquo;ll see a number of fellers, mostly good fellers,
more than half of &rsquo;em believing me to be the rustler they&rsquo;re
all looking for. Well, for one thing you can&rsquo;t put me on a
vigilance committee with folks suspecting me. It isn&rsquo;t
fair either way, to me or them. Then, in the second
place, I&rsquo;ve got a say. I tell you, Doc, straight up and
down, as man to man, I don&rsquo;t hunt with hounds that are
snapping at my shoulders in the run. I&rsquo;m either a rustler
or I&rsquo;m not. I choose to say I&rsquo;m not. That being so I
guess I&rsquo;m the most interested in running these gophers,
who are, to their holes. Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to
do. But I&rsquo;m going to do it in my own way, and not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
under any man&rsquo;s command. I&rsquo;ve got a few dollars by
me and so long as they last, and my horse lasts out, I&rsquo;m
going to get busy. You&rsquo;re a man of intelligence, so I
guess you&rsquo;ll see my point. Anyway, I hunt alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a lucky thing for Jim Thorpe that he was dealing
with a really strong man, and a fearless one. One
weak spot in the character of Doc Crombie, one trifling
pettiness, which could have taken umbrage at the defiance
of his authority, one atom of small-mindedness, whereby
he could have been influenced by the curious evidence
against this man, and the yelping hounds of Barnriff
would have been let loose, and set raging at his heels.
As it was, Doc Crombie, whatever may have been his
faults, was before all things a man.</p>
<p>He turned from Jim with a shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plain speakin&rsquo;s good med&rsquo;cine,&rdquo; he said, glancing
coldly over his shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spoke a heap plain.
So will I. Hit your own trail, boy. But remember, this
dogone rustler&rsquo;s got to be rounded up and finished off as
neat as a rawhide rope&rsquo;ll do it. If he ain&rsquo;t found&ndash;&ndash;wal,
we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to clear Barnriff of this trouble anyways. I
don&rsquo;t guess you need a heap of extry-ordinary understandin&rsquo;
to get my meaning. You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a big chanct&ndash;&ndash;why,
take it. Gay,&rdquo; he said, turning abruptly to the
butcher, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll make the tally of the committee.
We start out to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>TERROR</h3>
</div>
<p>Eve was alone. Never in all her life had she been so
absolutely alone as now. She rocked herself to and fro
beside her kitchen stove, her thoughts and fears rioting
through body and mind, until she sat shivering with terror
in the warmth of her own fireside.</p>
<p>It was nearly nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening and the
vigilantes were due back in the village before midnight.
What would be their news? What&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;? She paused,
listening fearfully. But the sound she heard was only a
creaking of the frame of her little home.</p>
<p>The suspense was nerve racking. Would it never end?
Yes, she felt it would end&ndash;&ndash;certainly, inevitably. And the
conviction produced a fresh shudder in her slight body.
Three hours ago she had seen Jim Thorpe and his jaded
horse return to the village. She had longed to seek him
out&ndash;&ndash;he had gone to Peter Blunt&rsquo;s hut for the night&ndash;&ndash;and
question him. But she had refrained. Whatever Jim&rsquo;s
actual attitude toward her, she must think of him in her
calculations as the bitterest enemy. In her tense nervousness
she laughed hysterically. Jim, her enemy? How
ridiculous it seemed. And a year ago he had been her
lover.</p>
<p>For a moment her terror eased. Thoughts of a year
ago were far removed from the horror of her present. Jim
could be nobody&rsquo;s enemy unless it were his own. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
enemy? Never. He was too kind, too honest, too much
a man. And yet&ndash;&ndash;the haunting of the moment broke
out afresh&ndash;&ndash;he must be. In self-defense he must be
her enemy. He could not clear his own name otherwise.</p>
<p>She pondered. Her eyes grew less wild, less frightened,
and a soft glow welled up in her heart as she
thought of the man whom she declared must be her
enemy. Just for a moment she thought how different
things might have been had only her choice fallen otherwise.
Then she stifled her regrets, and, in an instant,
was caught again in the toils of the horror that lay before
her.</p>
<p>She tried to think out what she must do when the
vigilantes returned. What would be her best course?
She wanted advice so badly. She wanted to talk it over
with somebody, somebody who had clear judgment,
somebody who could think with a man&rsquo;s cool courage.
Yes, she wanted a man&rsquo;s advice. And there was no
man to whom she could appeal. Jim?&ndash;&ndash;no, she decided
that she could not go to him. She felt that, for safety,
she had seen too much of him already. Peter? Ah,
yes! But the thought of him only recalled to her mind
another trouble with which she was beset. It was one,
which, amidst the horror of the matter of the cattle
stealing, had, for the moment, been banished from her
mind.</p>
<p>She remembered the note she had received from him
that morning, and groped for it in the bosom of her
dress. It had reached her by a special messenger, and
its tone, for Peter, was urgent and serious. She found it
at last, and straightened out its creases. She was thankful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
for the occupation, and lingered over it before she
read it over again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Eve</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Elia returned home? He left camp two
mornings ago, before sun up. I&rsquo;ve been hunting him
ever since, but can&rsquo;t locate him. I&rsquo;ve a shrewd idea that
he&rsquo;s on the trail of your Will, but can&rsquo;t be sure. Anyway,
I&rsquo;m worried to death about him, and, as a last
resource, thought he might have gone back to you.
Send word by the bearer.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Yours,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Peter Blunt</span>.&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elia gone. The thought filled her with dismay. Elia
was the one person in the world she still clung to. And
now he had gone&ndash;&ndash;been spirited away.</p>
<p>She thought of the poor stricken lad with his crooked
body. She loved him as she might have loved a child of
her own. Yes, he was much more to her than her brother.
Had not she cared and struggled for him all these years?
He had become part of her very life.</p>
<p>And Peter, in whose care she had left him, had failed
her. Who on earth could she trust, if not Peter? She
blamed him, blamed him bitterly; but, in her heart, she
knew she had no right to. Peter would not willingly
hurt her, and she knew well enough that if Elia had
gone it was through no carelessness of this gentle, kindly
man.</p>
<p>She put the note away, and sat staring into the fire.
The change of thought had eased the pitch of her nerves
for a moment. If she could only blot that other out
altogether&ndash;&ndash;but even as the wish was formulated in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
brain, the horror and dread were on her again crushing
her.</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet and paced the room with rapid,
uneven strides. She could not rest. The dread of the
return of the vigilantes obsessed her. She found herself
vaguely wondering if they were all out. Was Doc Crombie
out? No, she knew he wasn&rsquo;t. That was something.
That was the man she most dreaded. To her heated
imagination he seemed inevitable. He could not fail in
his self-imposed mission. He would hunt his man down.
He would never pause until the wretched victim was
swinging at the rope end.</p>
<p>She shuddered. This sort of thing had never before
impressed its horror upon her as it did now. How
should it? It had always seemed so far away, so remote
from her life. And now&ndash;&ndash;oh, God, to think that
its shadow was so near her!</p>
<p>Then for a second her struggling brain eased with an
undefined hope. She was thinking of how they had tried
to track Will before, and how they had failed. She tried
to tell herself that then their incentive had been even
greater. Had it not been the greed of gold? And she
well knew its power with these men. Yes, it suggested
hope. But that one passing gleam vanished all too
swiftly. She felt in her inmost heart that no such luck
would serve him now. These men were bloodhounds on
a trail of blood. They were demanding a life, nor would
they lift their noses from the scent until their work was
accomplished.</p>
<p>It was not the man. It was not the thought of his
life that drove her frantic now. It was the horror of such
an end to her wretched marriage. The wife of a cattle-thief!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
The widow of a man lynched by his fellow citizens!
She buried her face in her hands, and hard, dry
sobs racked her body.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood thus. Then she suddenly
lifted her head, her eyes staring, her whole attitude
alert, intent. There was a sound outside. She heard
the clank of the latch. And now an awkward shuffling
gait just outside her door. She moved toward the
parlor and stood listening in the doorway.</p>
<p>Suddenly a light broke in upon her. That awkward
footstep! She knew it! Her relief was heartbreaking.
It was Elia. With a rush she was at the door, and the
next moment she dragged the boy in, and was crooning
over him like some mother over a long-lost child.</p>
<p>But the boy pushed her away roughly. His calm face
and gentle eyes now shone with excitement, one of those
excitements she so dreaded in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit, sis,&rdquo; he cried sharply. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no use fer sech
slobberin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t a kid. Say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, eyeing her with his head bent sideways
in the extraordinary attitude which a cruel nature had
inflicted upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s eyes were full of a yearning tenderness. His rebuff
meant nothing to her devotion. She believed it to
be only his way. Part of the cruel disease for which he
must be pitied and not blamed.</p>
<p>But his broken sentence remained uncompleted. His
eyes were fixed upon her face bland yet sparkling with
the thought behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter sent word to me to-day that you&ndash;&ndash;you were
lost,&rdquo; Eve said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>The boy laughed without relaxing a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he? He&rsquo;s a fule someways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed into the kitchen and took Eve&rsquo;s rocking-chair.
She followed him, and stood leaning against the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&ndash;&ndash;you didn&rsquo;t get lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you folks make me sick. Why &rsquo;ud I get lost
more&rsquo;n other fellers? You guess I&rsquo;m a kid&ndash;&ndash;but I ain&rsquo;t.
Lost! Gee! Say, sis, Peter orter know&rsquo;d wher&rsquo; I was.
I told him I was goin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; I went. Sure I went.&rdquo;
He rubbed his delicate hands together in his glee. His
eyes sparkled again with rising excitement. But Eve
forgot her fears for him now; she was interested. She
was lifted out of her own despair by his evident joy, and
waited for him to tell his story.</p>
<p>But Elia had his own way of doing things, and that
way was rarely a pleasant one. Nor was it now, as Eve
was quickly to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, Peter&rsquo;s a fule, someways&ndash;&ndash;but I like him.
He&rsquo;s real good. Say, sis, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give me all the
gold he finds. He said so. Yep. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll do it.
Guess he&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s sure why I didn&rsquo;t do what he
told me not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat blinking up at his sister with impish amusement.
Suddenly something in his expression stirred his
sister to alarm. Nor could she have said how it came
to her, or what the nature of the alarm. It was there
undefined, but none the less certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he tell you not to do?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him away. Say, here, I&rsquo;ll tell you. It&rsquo;s a dandy
yarn. Y&rsquo;see I ain&rsquo;t just as other folks are, sis; there&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
things I ken do, an&rsquo; things I ken understand wot other
folks can&rsquo;t. Say, I ken trail like&ndash;&ndash;like a wolf. Well, I
guess one day I told Peter I could trail. I told him I
could trail your Will, an&rsquo; find out wher&rsquo; he got his gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s demand was almost a shriek. The boy
nodded his bent head wisely, and his eyes lit with malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t give him away? You wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;you
wouldn&rsquo;t? He&rsquo;s my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pleading in his sister&rsquo;s voice was pitiful to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure what Peter made me promise&ndash;&ndash;or I
wouldn&rsquo;t get his gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve breathed more freely. But her relief was short-lived.</p>
<p>The boy began to laugh. It was a soft chuckle that
found no expression in his face. The sound of it sent a
shudder through the harassed woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t give him away,&rdquo; he said suddenly.
&ldquo;Sis, I trailed an&rsquo; trailed, an&rsquo; I found him. Gee, I found
him. He was diggin&rsquo; his gold, but it was in the hides of
cattle, an&rsquo; with a red-hot brandin&rsquo; iron. Gee! I watched
him, but he didn&rsquo;t see me. Oh, no, I took care of that.
If he&rsquo;d seen me he&rsquo;d sure have killed me. Say, sis, your
Will&rsquo;s a cattle-thief. You&rsquo;ve heerd tell of &rsquo;em, ain&rsquo;t
you? Do you know what they do to cattle-thieves?
I&rsquo;ll tell you. They hang &rsquo;em. They hang &rsquo;em slow.
They haul &rsquo;em up, an&rsquo; their necks stretch, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; then
they die. Then the coyotes come round an&rsquo; jump up
an&rsquo; try to eat &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; they hang there till they stink.
That&rsquo;s how they treat cattle-rustlers. An&rsquo; Will&rsquo;s a
cattle-rustler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, be quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face was terrible in its horror, but it
only seemed to give the boy pleasure, for he went on
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no use in squealin&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t give him
away. I&rsquo;d like to, because I&rsquo;d like to see Will with his
neck pulled sure. But I want Peter&rsquo;s gold, an&rsquo; I
wouldn&rsquo;t get it if I give him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come straight back here?&rdquo; Eve questioned
him sharply, a faint hope stirring her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, sis, straight here.&rdquo; He laughed silently while
he watched her with feline glee. &ldquo;An&rsquo; jest as fast as I
could get, too. You see, I guessed I might miss Doc
Crombie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc Crombie?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes dilated. She stood
like one petrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You see I couldn&rsquo;t give Will away because of
Peter. But I told him wher&rsquo; the stolen cattle wer&rsquo;. An&rsquo;
that I&rsquo;d seen the rustlers at work, an&rsquo; if he got busy
he&rsquo;d get &rsquo;em right off, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he got no further; Eve had him by the shoulders
in a clutch that chilled his heart to a maddening fear.
His eyes stared, and he gasped as though about to
faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him that&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you? You never did!
You couldn&rsquo;t! You wouldn&rsquo;t dare! Oh, God, and to
think! Elia, Elia! Say you didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll never&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll
never get Peter&rsquo;s gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was beside herself. She had no idea of
what she was saying. All she knew was that Doc
Crombie had been told of Will&rsquo;s hiding-place, and, for
all she knew, might be on his way there now. Discovery
was certain; and discovery meant&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>But suddenly she realized the boy&rsquo;s condition. He
was on the verge of collapse from sheer dread of physical
hurt. His face was ashen, and his eyes were almost
starting from their sockets. In an agony of remorse
and fear she released him and knelt before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Elia. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you. But&ndash;&ndash;but
you haven&rsquo;t told Doc?&rdquo; she cried piteously. &ldquo;Say
you haven&rsquo;t, dear. Oh, God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She abruptly buried her face in her hands as though
to shut out the horrid sight of this thing her brother
had done.</p>
<p>Elia recovered quickly, but his vicious glee had
dropped to a sulky savagery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fule, sis,&rdquo; he said, in a sullen tone. &ldquo;I
sure did it for you&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; &rsquo;cos I hate him. But say,&rdquo; he
cried, becoming suddenly suspicious. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell
Doc who it was. I kep&rsquo; my promise to Peter. I sure
didn&rsquo;t give him away. So why for do you raise sech a
racket? An&rsquo; anyway if he hangs you won&rsquo;t be married
to him no more. You&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, listening. The sound of a horse galloping
could be plainly heard. The noise abruptly ceased,
and the boy looked up with the light of understanding
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo; the boys, sis. One o&rsquo; Doc&rsquo;s boys.
Mebbe&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was interrupted by the opening of the outer
door, and Peter Blunt strode in.</p>
<p>The expression of the man&rsquo;s face was sufficient explanation
of his unceremonious visit. He made no pretense
at apology. He glanced swiftly round the little
parlor, and finally espied Eve and her brother through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
the open kitchen door. He hurried across and stood
before them, his eyes on the boy he had spent two days
searching for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God I&rsquo;ve found you, laddie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>But Eve cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter, Peter, thank God you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Immediately the man&rsquo;s eyes were transferred to her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded sharply. And some of
the girl&rsquo;s terror suddenly clutched at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s found him. Will, I mean. Will&rsquo;s the cattle-thief.
He found him in the midst of re-branding. And
he came right in and told&ndash;&ndash;told Doc Crombie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant Elia was sitting forward defending
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him who he was. Sure I didn&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cos
you said I wouldn&rsquo;t get that gold if I did&ndash;&ndash;if I give
him away. I didn&rsquo;t give him away, sure&ndash;&ndash;sure. I jest
told Doc where he&rsquo;d find the rustlers. That&rsquo;s all. That
ain&rsquo;t giving Will away, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter ignored the boy&rsquo;s defense. His shrewd
mind was working swiftly. Here was his own unspoken
suspicion of the man verified. The whole situation
was all too clear. He turned to Eve with a sharp
inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Will&rsquo;s the cattle-thief. You knew it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and wrung her hands piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I didn&rsquo;t know it. Indeed, indeed, I didn&rsquo;t.
Lately I suspected&ndash;&ndash;thought&ndash;&ndash;but I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Then
she cried helplessly. &ldquo;Oh, Peter, what&rsquo;s to be done?
We must&ndash;&ndash;we must save him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>In an instant Elia was on his feet protesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for you want to save him?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a crook. He&rsquo;s a thief. He&rsquo;s bad&ndash;&ndash;I tell you he&rsquo;s
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter suddenly thrust out one great hand and
pushed him back into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there and keep quiet,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;Now,
let&rsquo;s think. You told Doc, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted the boy sulkily. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; out
after &rsquo;em to-night. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m glad, &rsquo;cos they&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they get him you&rsquo;ll never get your gold, laddie,
because you&rsquo;ve given him away. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve, watching these two, began to realize something
of the working of Peter&rsquo;s mind. He meant to win Elia
over to his side, and was adopting the only possible
means.</p>
<p>The boy remained obstinately silent, and Peter went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, which would you rather do, get that
gold&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s plenty; it comes right through here to
Barnriff&ndash;&ndash;or see Will hang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his hatred of Will, the boy was dazzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Will hang&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d rather git the
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Peter, with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;ther&rsquo;s just
one way for you to get it. You&rsquo;ve got to put us wise how
to get to Will to warn him before Doc gets him. If Will
hangs, you don&rsquo;t get your gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden hope lit Eve&rsquo;s troubled face. This man, she
knew, was to be Will&rsquo;s savior&ndash;&ndash;her savior. Her heart
swelled with thankfulness and hope. This man, without
a second&rsquo;s demur, had embraced her cause, was ready to incriminate
himself, to save the worst criminal a cattle country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
knows, because&ndash;&ndash;just because he wanted to help a
woman, who was nothing to him, and never could be
anything to him. It was the love he had for all suffering
humanity, the wonderful charity of his kindly heart, that
made him desire to help all those who needed his help.</p>
<p>She was listening now to the manner in which he extracted
from her unwilling brother the information he
sought. He did it bit by bit, with much care and deliberation.
He wanted no mistake. The direction in which
Will&rsquo;s secret corrals lay must be given with the last word
in exactness, for any delay in finding him might upset his
purpose.</p>
<p>Having extracted all the information necessary, he gave
the lad a final warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, Elia, you&rsquo;re a good lad&ndash;&ndash;better than
you seem; but I&rsquo;m not going to be played with. I&rsquo;ve
got gold in plenty, sure, and you&rsquo;re going to get it if you
stay right here, and don&rsquo;t say a word to any one about
Will or this cattle-rustling. If you do anything that prevents
Will getting clear away, or let folks know that he&rsquo;s
the rustler, then you get no gold&ndash;&ndash;not one cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, wot&rsquo;s this I&rsquo;ve heerd about Jim? Guess you
want him to get the blame. You want &rsquo;em to hang Jim
Thorpe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s cunning was paralyzing. Eve&rsquo;s eyes
widened with a fresh fear, and, for a moment, Peter was
gravely silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;for a while he must still have
the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could get hold of Jim,&rdquo; he said regretfully.
&ldquo;Amongst other things, I want his horse.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>In an instant Eve remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s over in your shack. I saw him go there at sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s face cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll all go over there.
I&rsquo;ll go by the front way, with Elia. You sneak out the
back way after we&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>FOR A WOMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Seated before the cold stove in Peter Blunt&rsquo;s hut, Jim
Thorpe was lost in moody thought. His day had been
long and wearying. He had risen before sun-up with
little enough hope in his heart to cheer his day in the
saddle, and now he was contemplating his blankets at
night with even less.</p>
<p>Search, search. That had been his day. A fruitless
search for the one man whom he now believed to be the
only person who could lift the blight of suspicion from
his overburdened shoulders.</p>
<p>Yes, where most Eve had sought to shield, she had
most surely betrayed by her woman&rsquo;s weakness and fear.
For the truth had been forced upon Jim&rsquo;s unsuspicious
mind even against himself. Eve&rsquo;s terror, during her long
talk with him on his return from McLagan&rsquo;s ranch, had
done the very thing she had most sought to prevent. Her
whole attitude had told him its own story of her anxiety
for some one, and that some one could only have been her
husband. And the rest had been brought about by the
arguments of his own common sense.</p>
<p>At first her fear had only suggested the anxiety of a
friend for himself, at the jeopardy in which public suspicion
had placed him. Now he laughed at the conceit
of the thought, although, at the time, it had seemed
natural enough. Then the intensity of her fears had become
so great, and the personal, selfish note in her attitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
so pronounced, that his suspicion was aroused, and
he found himself groping for its meaning, its necessity.</p>
<p>Her terror seemed absurd. It could not be for him.
It was out of all proportion. No, it was not for him.
Was it for herself? He could see no reason. Then,
why? For whom? And in a flash, as such realizations
sometimes do come, even to the most unsuspicious, the
whole thing leaped into his focus. If she had nothing to
fear for herself, for whom did she fear? There was but one
person&ndash;&ndash;her husband.</p>
<p>If she feared for her husband, then she must suspect
him. If she suspected, then there must be reason. But
once this key was put into his hand, it needed little argument
to make the whole thing plain. Point after point
occurred to his mind carrying with each a conviction that
was beyond the necessity of any argument that he could
offer. He saw the whole thing with much the same instinctive
conviction with which the wife had seen it.</p>
<p>Will had calculated his revenge on him carefully. He
saw now what Eve had missed. The using of the
&ldquo;<img src='images/dstar.png' alt='double star' />&rdquo;
brand,&ndash;&ndash;which he must have stolen from Jim&rsquo;s implement
shed&ndash;&ndash;the running of the small bunch of McLagan&rsquo;s cattle
with his, Jim&rsquo;s; these things had been well thought out,
a carefully calculated revenge for his interference on the
night Will had come so near to killing his own wife. He
meant to throw suspicion upon him, suspicion which, in
such a country of hot-headed cattlemen, was so narrowly
removed from conviction.</p>
<p>So he had set out on his solitary quest to find this man,
and had failed. He felt that he must find him, yet he hardly
knew how it could serve him to do so. For there was
that in the back of his mind which sorely troubled him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>He was thinking of Eve. Poor Eve! With Will
found, or suspicion directed upon him, her troubles would
be a hundred times magnified. The man was her husband,
and there was no doubt in his mind, that, whatever
his faults, she still loved him. If he needed confirmation
of his belief there was her anxiety, her terrible dread when
talking to him. The position was one to tax a far more
subtle mind than his. What was to be done?</p>
<p>Clear himself he must, but every way he looked seemed
to be barred by the certainty of bringing disgrace and unhappiness
upon Eve. The thought revolted him, and
yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet, why should he take the blame? Why
should he leave his name stinking in the mire of such a
crime? It was maddening. What devilish luck! Was
there no end to the cruelty of his fate?</p>
<p>Suddenly, he laughed. He had to, or the thing would
drive him to something desperate. Fate had such refreshing
ways of getting at a man. She brought about
his disgrace through no fault of his own, and then refused
him the only means of clearing himself. Fortune certainly
could be a jade when she chose. Clear himself at
the expense of the one woman in the world he loved?
No, he couldn&rsquo;t do that. Perhaps that was why he was
given such a cruel chance.</p>
<p>But his whimsical moment was quickly gone. The
tragedy of his position was all too harsh for such levity,
and he frowned down at the cold iron of Peter&rsquo;s stove.
What must he do? He could see no way out. For
perhaps the hundredth time that day his question remained
unanswered. One thing he had made up his
mind to, although he could not see how it was to help
him in his dilemma. He must find Will Henderson.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>He rose from his seat, stretched his aching limbs, and
turned to his blankets.</p>
<p>But he did not unroll them. The heavy step of some
one approaching startled him. Who could it be? Peter
was away&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; He listened intently,
and suddenly his eyes lit. It was like Peter&rsquo;s step. He
went to the door and threw it open, and in a moment was
greeting the one man whose coming at such a moment
could have made him feel glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Peter, this is bully,&rdquo; he cried, shaking the big
man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t guess you&rsquo;d be coming along in.
Who&rsquo;s that with you? Eh? Oh, Elia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded. But his usual smile was lacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Eve&rsquo;s just coming along. Ah, here she is,&rdquo;
he added, as the girl suddenly appeared in the doorway.
&ldquo;Come in, my dear,&rdquo; he went on kindly. &ldquo;Guess we
caught Jim before he got down for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim offered the girl no greeting. All thought of
formalities was driven from his mind at the sight of her
expression. The hunted look in her eyes was even
greater than it had been two days ago, and he wondered
what fresh development had brought it about. He was
not long left in doubt. Peter eyed him ruefully, and
then glanced at the door which was still open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s trouble, Jim, fresh trouble, so&ndash;&ndash;I guess I&rsquo;ll shut
this door tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was doing so, Jim pushed the chair toward
Eve, into which she almost fell. Then he glanced at
Elia, speculating. As Peter returned to the group he
dropped back and seated himself on the rough bed, waiting
for enlightenment. Peter leaned himself against the
table, his grizzled face frowning thoughtfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m needing a horse to-night&ndash;&ndash;now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s got to do sixty miles between this and sundown to-morrow.
I want yours. Can I have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s shrewd blue eyes were steadily fixed on
Jim&rsquo;s face. He was putting all his knowledge of the
ranchman to the test in his own subtle way. He was
asking this man to help him against himself. He was
asking this man to help him prevent his removing the
unmerited suspicion with which he was branded. But
he intended to do it openly, frankly. And his reason
was because he understood a good deal of human nature,
and of Jim Thorpe particularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have him. What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Eve cried, starting up to prevent Peter answering.</p>
<p>But the big man motioned her to calm herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Eve, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This thing&rsquo;s
between Jim an&rsquo; me. And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going
to be much explanation needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded, and his glance fell on Elia. He was wondering
what part the boy was playing in the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Will,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get him
warned&ndash;&ndash;for her sake.&rdquo; He nodded in Eve&rsquo;s direction,
but turned away quickly as her face dropped into her
two hands and remained hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to tell me any more, Peter,&rdquo; said
Jim, huskily. &ldquo;Just give me the other details. You
see, I fancy I know all about him, except his whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve looked up startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she whispered in awe.</p>
<p>Jim nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought things out this last two days,&rdquo; he said
quietly. Then he turned to Peter. &ldquo;But this warning.
What&rsquo;s made it necessary? Have others been&ndash;&ndash;thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They&rsquo;ve been put wise.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes sought
the unsmiling face of Elia. &ldquo;You see, Elia hunted him
out. He&rsquo;s told Doc where he&rsquo;ll find the rustlers. But
mercifully he didn&rsquo;t say who the rustler was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Elia hates Will,&rdquo; Jim said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc&rsquo;s setting out to-night to&ndash;&ndash;find him,&rdquo; Peter
added.</p>
<p>Jim glanced from Eve to the grizzled man. Just for a
second he marveled at him. Then the feeling passed as
recollections flew through his mind of a dozen and one
kindnesses of heart which this quaint Englishman had
performed. This was just the sort of thing Peter would
do. He would simply, and unconcernedly, thrust his
head into the lion&rsquo;s jaws to help anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to take the warning?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Then Peter added apologetically, with a
swift glance in Eve&rsquo;s direction, &ldquo;You see, we can&rsquo;t let
&rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadowy smile grew into Jim&rsquo;s eyes. Peter wanted
his horse for a purpose. And that very purpose would
inevitably drive the brand which was already upon him
deeper and deeper into his flesh. He was calmly asking
him to sacrifice himself for Eve. He glanced in the girl&rsquo;s
direction, and all the old love was uppermost in his
simple heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you get in?&rdquo; he asked Peter, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been in the saddle all day?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. But that&rsquo;s no con&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Only I was thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes were still on Eve. The girl was looking
straight before her at the stove. She could only wait.
These men, she felt, were shouldering her burden. But
she was anxious. Somehow she hadn&rsquo;t the same knowledge
of Jim that Peter had. But then, how should she?
Her point of view was so different.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jim started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Peter, old friend, you can&rsquo;t have the horse&ndash;&ndash;I
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter started forward. He was startled out of his belief
in the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up, Peter. Eve&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he said. Then he
glanced at Elia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry that warning. And I&rsquo;ll tell
you why. Oh, no,&rdquo; as Eve suddenly started to protest,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to speak common sense. Here&rsquo;s the
facts which you, old friend, with all your wisdom, seem
to have overlooked.&rdquo; He smiled up into Peter&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;First, the man who goes must ride light. You can&rsquo;t be
accused of that. You see, we&rsquo;ve sure got to get there
first. My plug&rsquo;s been out all day, and has only had
about four hours&rsquo; rest. I can get the most out of him
the easiest. Then, you see, you&rsquo;re known to be in town,
and if you pike the trail to-night folks&rsquo;ll get guessing.
Then, you see, it&rsquo;s my business to be out&ndash;&ndash;they expect it
of me. Then&ndash;&ndash;if things go wrong&ndash;&ndash;which I don&rsquo;t guess
they will&ndash;&ndash;my name stinks a bit around here, and, well,
a bit more or less don&rsquo;t cut any ice. Then there&rsquo;s
another thing&ndash;&ndash;Elia. You&rsquo;ve got to keep a close eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
on him, sure. If they get at him&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Anyway,
that&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t do under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s face grew almost stern as he listened to
the marshaling of the man&rsquo;s arguments. Jim saw his
look and understood. But he had clearly made up his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Peter. You can&rsquo;t have that horse. I&rsquo;m
going to get the saddle on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to go. But the big man suddenly barred his
way. His face was stern and set&ndash;&ndash;something like a
thunder-cloud seemed to have settled upon his kindly
brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on. I&rsquo;ll allow your arguments are mostly clear.
Guess you&rsquo;ll have to go. But I want to tell you this, Jim.
If things go wrong, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll shoot the man that lays hands
on you. I&rsquo;ll shoot him dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve was on her feet at Jim&rsquo;s side, and her soft
hands were gripping his arm with a nervous clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jim,&rdquo; she cried, with tears in her eyes.
&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you mustn&rsquo;t go. I see it now. I didn&rsquo;t see it
before. You&ndash;&ndash;you are branded now, and&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re
going to help him. Oh, Jim, you mustn&rsquo;t! We had no
right to ask for your horse. Indeed, indeed we hadn&rsquo;t.
You mustn&rsquo;t go. Neither of you must. No, please, please
stay. It means hanging if you are&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say anything more, Eve,&rdquo; Jim said, gently
but firmly releasing himself from her hold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought
of all those things. Besides, you must never forget that
Will&ndash;&ndash;is my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter could stand no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, almost roughly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late enough
already. Maybe they&rsquo;ll be starting directly. Here, Elia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
you tell us just where Will&rsquo;s in hiding, and mind you don&rsquo;t
miss anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took barely five minutes for Elia to give the required
directions again, which he did ungraciously enough. But
Peter verified his account with the original story, and was
satisfied.</p>
<p>Then the two men went out and saddled the horse. In
three minutes Jim was in the saddle, and Peter gripped him
by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good God&rsquo;ll help you out for this, Jim. So
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the horseman passed the hut Eve and Elia were
standing before the closed door. Jim saw them, but he
would not pause. However, his keen ears heard the whispered
&ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; which the woman threw after him.
And somehow he felt that nothing else in his life much
mattered.</p>
<p>A few moments later Eve was at her gate, fumbling for
the latch. Elia was at her side, looking out at the lights
of the village. Suddenly he turned and raised his beautiful
face to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, sis, you&rsquo;re a fule woman,&rdquo; he declared sharply.
He was listening to the sounds of bustle down at the
saloon. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear? That&rsquo;s the boys. They&rsquo;ve
come in, and they&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; ready to start with Doc. If
they get him&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;ll hang him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him? Who? What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrified woman was staring down into his calm
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, no! They can&rsquo;t! They won&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
good&ndash;&ndash;too brave! God will never let them. It would
be too cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I guess you&rsquo;d be sorry some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve was fumbling again at the gate. Nor could
the boy extract another word from her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL OF THE RUSTLERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The blackness of night begins to stir. Ahead and
above roll vague shadows, darkening, threatening, in
the immensity of their wave-like shapes. Away behind
the stars shine pitifully, for a dim gray light in the east
heralds the coming of day. Slowly the shadows change
from black to a faint gray, and their rolling becomes more
pronounced. Now, with each passing moment, the eastern
light grows, and the darkness of the west responds;
now, too, the shadows show themselves for what they are.
They stir and seethe like the churning of water nearly
boiling, under the rising zephyrs of mountain air. They
are the dense morning mists, a hazy curtain shutting out
the mountain splendor beyond.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour a wonderful metamorphosis.
A tinted fringe of cloud appears on the mists high up, and
gives the impression of a beam of sunlight amidst the
shadows. But no sun has broken the eastern sky-line, nor
will it for another half-hour. Yet the light increases, and
the swirling mists become a rosy cloudland, deep, ruddy,
and exquisitely beautiful. The living fog rolls up, lifting,
lifting, and every moment the picture grows in beauty and
in its wonders of changing colors.</p>
<p>Eastward the horizon lights a glowing yellow, shot with
feathery dashes of ruddy orange; yellow to green, and then
the gray of the high starlit vault. But the stars are dimming,
whimpering under their loss of power. Their archenemy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of day is approaching, and they must shrink away
and hide till the fiery path of the monarch of the universe
cools, and they are left again to their own.</p>
<p>Doc Crombie was riding at the head of his men when
the sun cleared the horizon. He was staring ahead at
the still hazy foot-hills, the hiding-place of the criminal
he sought. The light of battle was in his keen, quick,
luminous eyes. His face was set and stern. There was
no mercy in the set of his jaws, in the drawn shaggy
brows. He was out to rid the country, his country, of a
scourge, a pestilence neither he nor his fellow townsmen
would tolerate.</p>
<p>The rest of the vigilantes rode behind him, no less
stern-faced than their leader. With fresh horses they
had traveled long and hard that night. The journey had
been chilly, and the trail rough. Their tempers were at
a low ebb, and the condition only added to their determination
to hang the man as soon as he was in their
power.</p>
<p>Doc drew rein suddenly and called Smallbones to his
side. The trail, which had now faded into something
little better than a cattle track, was leading into the
mouth of a narrow valley, bordered on either side by
towering, forest-clad hills. He pointed ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That blamed kid said we&rsquo;d keep right on down this
cuttin&rsquo; to the third hill on the left,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nigh
four miles. Then we&rsquo;d find a clump of scrub with two
lone pines standin&rsquo; separate. Here we&rsquo;d get a track of
cattle marked plenty. Then we&rsquo;d follow that for nigh
two miles, and we&rsquo;d drop into the rustlers&rsquo; hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Don&rsquo;t sound a heap o&rsquo; trouble,&rdquo; said Smallbones,
cheerfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m not figgerin&rsquo; the trouble. But we&rsquo;ve traveled
slow. We won&rsquo;t make it for an hour an&rsquo; more, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
well past sun-up now. It was waitin&rsquo; for the boys to git
in. I sort o&rsquo; wish I&rsquo;d brought that kid along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were moving on again at a rapid canter, and
Smallbones was riding at his side. The little man, like
the rest, was armed liberally. But whereas the others
were, for the most part, content with two guns, he had
four. It would not be for lack of desire on his part if
somebody did not die before noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help startin&rsquo; late,&rdquo; grumbled the little
man. &ldquo;An&rsquo; as fer that kid, I&rsquo;d sure &rsquo;a&rsquo; kep&rsquo; him with us.
Who&rsquo;s to say he ain&rsquo;t handed us a fool game? He&rsquo;s a
crank, anyways, an&rsquo; orter be looked after by State. He
guessed he see the rustlers at work, but didn&rsquo;t rec&rsquo;nize
&rsquo;em. I said right then he was bluffin&rsquo;. D&rsquo;you think he
wouldn&rsquo;t know Jim Thorpe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barkin&rsquo; that yet, eh!&rdquo; retorted Doc, sharply. &ldquo;Say,
boy,&rdquo; he went on with a great contempt, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re dirty.
Jim Thorpe ain&rsquo;t the man we&rsquo;re after. Leastways I
won&rsquo;t believe it till we git him red-handed. I wouldn&rsquo;t
be out to-night if I thought it was Jim Thorpe. We
left him back ther&rsquo; in the village. He&rsquo;s been out two
days chasin&rsquo; for rustlers. See here, you&rsquo;re mean on
him &rsquo;bout this thing, because things are queer his way.
An&rsquo; you ain&rsquo;t got savvee to see that it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cos things is
queer his way is just the reason he ain&rsquo;t the dogone
rustler we&rsquo;re chasin&rsquo;. You need to think a sight more.
Mebbe it hurts some, but it&rsquo;s a heap good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smallbones shot a swift, sidelong glance at the doctor,
in which there was little enough friendliness. He probably
had no friendliness for anybody.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hand you a noo buggy to a three-year-old driver
he&rsquo;s our man,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; grinned the sporting doctor promptly. And
Smallbones was the least bit sorry he had laid so generous
odds.</p>
<p>By this time day was in its full early-morning glory,
but they were passing from the dazzling light of the
plains into the more sheltered atmosphere of the valley.
Everywhere the hills rose about them, on either side and
ahead. The gloomy woods on the vast slopes threw a
marked shadow over the prospect. Ahead lay a wide
vista of tremendous mountains, with their crowning,
snow-bound peaks lost in a world of gray, fleecy cloud.
In the heart of one distant rift lay the steely bed of a
glacier, hoary with age and immovable as the very bedrocks
of the mountains themselves. It sloped away into
the distance, and lost itself in the heart of a mighty
ca&ntilde;on. Even to these men on their trail of death, living,
as they did, so adjacent to these mysterious wilds, the
scene was not without its awe.</p>
<p>The doctor was watching the hills to the left. The
first one seemed endless, and he sought a break in it in
every shadowed indentation upon its face. He was feeling
more anxious than his own words suggested. He
was a shrewd man who had understood the ring of truth
in Elia&rsquo;s story at once, but now, in face of this stupendous
world, he was wondering if he had been well advised in
leaving the boy behind. He had only done so on the
score of his crippled condition being a nuisance to them.
However, his doubt found no further expression now,
and his keen eyes watched for the landmarks in a way
that left him little chance of missing them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>At last the first hill came to a distinct end, and the
second rose higher and more rough. Its face was torn
and barren, and what timber there was grew low down
almost at its foot. The valley was narrowing, and the
rich prairie grass was changing to a lank tangle of weedy
tufts. There was a suspicion of moisture, too, in the
spongy tread. The sun further lost power here, between
these narrowing crags, and, although summer was well
advanced, the ground still bore the moist traces of the
mountain spring.</p>
<p>The second hill was passed quickly. It was merely a
split of the original mountain, the result, no doubt, of a
great volcanic upheaval in the early days of the world.
And now, as they rode on, the third and last landmark
before the two lone pines rapidly slipped away behind
them.</p>
<p>The leader bustled his horse. His nervous force was
at a great tension of impatience. He, like the rest of the
merciless band, was yearning for his goal.</p>
<p>At last the two lone pines loomed up. The eyes of
the men brightened with eagerness, and their leader felt
certain of the faith he had placed in Elia&rsquo;s story. Now
for the cattle tracks.</p>
<p>As they came abreast of the low bush, the doctor scattered
his men in various directions to hunt for the trail.
Nor did the matter take long. In less than five minutes
two of the ranch hands lit on the tracks simultaneously.
A great broad track of hoof-marks deeply indented in the
soft ground stretched away up over the shoulder of the
hill. So plain were they that the horsemen were able to
follow them at a gallop.</p>
<p>Away up the hillside they sped. The way was a sharp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
incline, but smooth and wide, and free from obstruction.
And in ten minutes they were pausing to breathe their
hard-blowing horses on the shoulder of the hill, with a
wide view and a level track ahead of them.</p>
<p>The doctor turned to order a careful redistribution.
They were near the rustlers&rsquo; hollow now, he believed,
and it was his intention to leave nothing to chance.
Each man received his instructions for the moment
when the hollow should be reached, for Elia had given
him full details of its locality, and the possibilities of
approach.</p>
<p>He knew it to be a mere cup, with, apparently, no
entrance or exit, except the way they were now approaching
it. It had appeared to Elia to be surrounded by
towering hills, densely clad in forests of spruce and pine.
He had described the corral as being on the left front
from the entrance, and that a hut, backing into the flanking
woods, occupied the distance on the right.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s disposition, in consequence, was simple.
The whole party were to race at a gallop into the hollow.
The eight leaders were to ride straight for the hut,
no matter what fire might be opposed to them. The six
men immediately in their rear were to open out and
ride for the encompassing fringe of woods, lest any of
the rustlers should make for escape that way. While
the rest of the party were to ride for the corral, and
round up everything that looked like a saddle horse;
this last with a view to preventing any chances of ultimate
escape.</p>
<p>These matters settled they continued their journey
without loss of time. For every man of them was
sternly eager to come to clinches with their quarry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
The excited interest was running high as they neared
their goal. Then all at once Smallbones suddenly threw
the whole party into confusion by flinging his horse
abruptly upon its haunches, and wildly pointing up the
hillside on their immediate left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he cried, furiously. &ldquo;Look at that. There!
There! There he goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no need for his added explanation.
Two hundred yards away to their left a horseman was
racing headlong in a parallel direction. It needed no
imagination to tell them that he was a scout carrying the
alarm to his comrades in the hollow beyond.</p>
<p>But his course was a different one to that which
might have been expected, for it showed no signs of
converging with the track below, and was significant of
an unsuspected, possibly secret entrance to the hiding-place.</p>
<p>But the doctor was a man for emergency. Four of
the men carried rifles, and these he warned to be ready
to fire on the fugitive when he gave the word.</p>
<p>Then he led his men at a race down the track.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was an inspiring spot for the imaginative.</p>
<p>A little cup of perfect emerald green set within the
darker border of the soft pinewoods. Above, the brilliant
sky poured down a dazzling light through the
funnel-like opening walled by an almost complete circle
of hills. But the circle was not quite complete. There
were three distinct, but narrow rifts, and they opened
out in three widely opposite directions. The cup rim
was almost equally divided into three.</p>
<p>In a spacious corral of raw timbers a number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
cattle were moving restlessly about, vainly searching for
something with which to satisfy their voracious morning
appetites. Close beside the corral was a small branding
forge, its fire smouldering dismally in the chill air.
Round about this, strewn upon the trampled grass, lay
a number of branding irons, coiled ropes, and all the
paraphernalia of a cattle-thief&rsquo;s trade, while beside the
corral itself were three telltale saddle horses, waiting
ready for their riders on the first sound of alarm.</p>
<p>Fifty yards away stood a log hut. It was solid and
practical, and comparatively capacious. A couple of
yards away a trench fire was burning cheerfully. And over
it, on an iron hook-stanchion, was suspended a prairie
cooking &ldquo;billy,&rdquo; from which a steaming aroma, most appetizing
at that hour of the morning, was issuing. Various
camping utensils were scattered carelessly about,
and a perfect atmosphere of the most innocent homeliness
prevailed.</p>
<p>On the sill of the hut door Will Henderson was seated
smoking, with his elbows planted on his knees, and his two
hands supporting the bowl of his pipe. His eyes were
as calmly contemplative as those of the stolen cattle in
the corral.</p>
<p>To judge by his expression, he had no thought of
danger, and his affairs were prospering to his keenest
satisfaction. His handsome boyish face had lost all
signs of dissipation. His eyes, if sullen, were clear, with
the perfect health of his outdoor, mountain life. Nor
was there anything of the vicious cattle-rustler about
him. His whole expression suggested the hard-working
youngster of the West, virile, strong, and bursting with
the love of life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>But here, again, appearances were all wrong. Will&rsquo;s
mood at that moment was dissatisfied, suspicious.
He was yearning for the flesh-pots of town, as exampled
by the bad whiskey and poker in Silas Rocket&rsquo;s
saloon.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground, close against the hut wall, two
low-looking half-breeds in gaudy shirts, and wearing
their black hair long and unkempt, were filling in the
time waiting for breakfast, shooting &ldquo;crap dice.&rdquo; The
only words spoken between them were the filthy epithets
and slang they addressed to the dice as they threw them,
and the deep-throated curses as money passed between
them.</p>
<p>No, there was little enough to suggest the traffic in
which these men were engaged. Yet each knew well
enough that the shadow of the rope was hanging over
him, and that, at any moment, he might have to face a
life and death struggle, which would add the crime of
murder to the list of his transgressions.</p>
<p>Will slowly removed his pipe from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t that grub ready?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Hi,
you, Pete, quit those dice an&rsquo; see to it. You&rsquo;re &lsquo;chores&rsquo;
to-day. We&rsquo;ve got to make forty miles with those
damned steers before sun-up to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, you. Git a look at the grub yourself. Say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off listening. Then he dropped the dice he
was preparing to throw, and a look of alarm leaped to
his eyes. &ldquo;I tink I hear hoofs. Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will was on his feet in a second. The sullen light
had vanished from his eyes and a startled look of apprehension
replaced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those plugs cinched up?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
And mechanically his hand fell on the butt of one of the
guns at his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; nodded the other half-breed.</p>
<p>All three listened acutely. Yes, the sound of galloping
was plain to their trained hearing. The mountains
carried a tremendous echo.</p>
<p>Without further words all three men set off at a run for
the corral. Will was the fleetest and reached his horse
first. In a second he was in the saddle and sat waiting,
and listening for the next alarming sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ganly, sure,&rdquo; he muttered, turning one ear in the
direction of the rapidly approaching sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like dogone &lsquo;get out,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Pete, sharply.
The shadow of the rope was very near him at that
moment.</p>
<p>The other half-breed nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; A sudden fear leaped into Will&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s others,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come on, and bad luck to
the hindmost! Joe&rsquo;s safe. He can get clear by the
south trail. They can&rsquo;t follow that way. I&rsquo;m for the
northeast. You best follow. Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His final exclamation burst from him at the echoing
reports of several rifles. And now the sound of galloping
hoofs was very near. The men waited no longer. Will
set spurs into his horse, and the half-breeds, following
him, raced for the northeast exit from the hollow.</p>
<p>But they had waited just a second or two longer than
was safe. For, as they reached the forest path, and were
vanishing beneath the shadowy trees, a fierce yell went up
behind them. Pete, looking back over his shoulder,
hissed his alarm to his speeding comrades.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, boy, it&rsquo;s Doc Crombie, an&rsquo; a whole gang. An&rsquo;
dey see us, too, sure. But dey never catch us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spurs went into their horses&rsquo; flanks and the race began.
For the noose of the rope was looming large and ominous
before their terrified eyes.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile from the hollow they divided and
went their ways in three different directions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>ON THE LITTLE BLUFF RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>Away to the west, where the plains cease and the hills
begin, where the Little Bluff River debouches upon the
plains from its secret path through ca&ntilde;on and crevasse,
Jim Thorpe was standing beside a low scrub bush, gazing
ruefully at his distressed horse. The poor brute was too
tired to move from where he stood, nipping at the rich
prairie grass about his feet. He still had the strength
and necessary appetite to do this, but that was about all.</p>
<p>In his anxiety to serve the woman he loved Jim had
done what years ago he had vowed never to do. He had
ridden his willing servant to a standstill.</p>
<p>The saddle had been removed for more than an hour
and was lying beside the bush, and the man, all impatience
and anxiety, was considering his position and
the possibility of fulfilling his mission. The outlook was
pretty hopeless. He judged that he had at least ten miles
to go, with no other means of making the distance than
his own two legs.</p>
<p>And then, what would be the use? Doc Crombie was
probably on the road. He had heard the men preparing
for the start before he left the village. True, they had
not overtaken him, but that was nothing. There were
other ways of reaching the rustlers&rsquo; hollow. He knew of
at least three trails, and the difference in the distance
between them was infinitesimal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>For all he knew the other men might have already
reached their destination. Yes, they probably had. He
had been out of the saddle more than an hour. It was
rotten luck. What would Eve think? He had failed
her in her extremity. At least his horse had. And it
was much the same thing. He realized now the folly of
his attempt on a tired horse. But then there had been
no time to get a fresh one. No possibility of getting one
without rousing suspicion. Truly his luck was devilish.</p>
<p>He sat down, his back propped against the stump of a
dead sapling. And from beneath the wide brim of his hat,
pressed low down upon his forehead, he gazed steadily
out over the greensward at the southern sky-line. His
face was moody. His feelings were depressed. What
could he do? In profound thought he sat clasping one
knee, which was drawn up almost to his chin.</p>
<p>The beauty and peace of the morning had no part in
his thoughts just now. Bitter and depressed feelings
alone occupied him. Behind him the noisy little river
sped upon its tumultuous way, just below sharp, high
banks, and entirely screened from where he sat. There
was a gossipy, companionable suggestion in the bustling
of the noisy waters. But the feeling was lost upon him.
He prayed for inspiration, for help. It was not for himself.
It was for a woman. And the bitterness of it all
was that he, he with all his longing, was denied the
power to help her.</p>
<p>He turned from the hills with a feeling of irritation.
Away to his left the prairie rolled upward, a steady rise to
a false sky-line something less than a mile away. There
was sign of neither man, nor beast, nor habitation of any
sort in the prospect. There was just the river bank on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
which he sat to break up the uniformity of the plain.
Here was bush, here were trees, but they were few and
scattered.</p>
<p>Presently he rose from his seat and moved over to his
horse. The animal lifted its head and looked wistfully
into his face. The man interpreted the appeal in his
own fashion. And the look hurt him. It was as if the
poor beast were asking to be allowed to go on feeding a
little longer. Jim was soft-hearted for all dumb animals,
and he quietly and softly swore at his luck. However,
he resaddled the animal to protect its back from the sun
and turned back again to the bush.</p>
<p>But he never reached his seat. At that instant the
quiet was suddenly and harshly broken. The stillness of
the plain seemed literally split with the crack of firearms.
Two shots rang out in rapid succession, and the faintest of
echoes from the distant hills suggested an opposing fire
at long range. But the first two shots were near, startlingly
near.</p>
<p>All was still again. The man stood staring out in the
direction whence came those ominous sounds. No, all
was not quite still again. His quick ears detected a faint
pounding of hoofs, and a racing thought flew through his
brain. His movements became swift, yet deliberate. He
crossed over to his horse and replaced the bit in its mouth.
Then he faced round at the rising ground and watched the
sky-line. It was thence that the reports had come, and
his practiced ears had warned him that they were pistol
shots.</p>
<p>Now he shaded his eyes gazing at one particular spot
on the sky-line. For his horse, too, was gazing thither,
with its ears sharply pricked. And, in consequence, he
knew that the man, or men who had fired those shots were
there, beyond the rise.</p>

</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-288.jpg' alt='' title='' width='370' height='561' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
Also he was gripping a heavy revolver in his hand.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>He waited. Suddenly a moving speck broke the sky-line.
Momentarily it grew larger. Now it was sufficiently
silhouetted for him to recognize it. A horseman was
coming toward him, racing as hard as spurs could drive
the beast under him.</p>
<p>Just for a moment he wondered. Then he glanced
swiftly round at the river behind him. Yes, the river.
This man was riding from the hills. And he understood
in a flash. He was pursued. The hounds had him out in
the open. The only shelter for miles around was the
sparse bush at the riverside, and&ndash;&ndash;the river itself. His
interest became excitement, and a sudden wild hope. He
now searched the horizon behind the man. There was
not a soul in sight&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;those two shots.</p>
<p>But the situation suddenly became critical for himself.
He realized that the fugitive had seen him. From a low
bending attitude over his horse&rsquo;s neck the man had suddenly
sat erect. Also he was gripping a heavy revolver
in his hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly a further excitement stirred the waiting man.
As the fugitive sat up he recognized him. It was Will
Henderson.</p>
<p>He was still a hundred yards away, but the distance
was rapidly narrowing. At fifty yards he, Jim, would be
well within range, and the memory of those two shots
warned him that the revolver in the horseman&rsquo;s hand
was no sort of bluff. It meant business, sure enough,
and his own identity was not in the least likely to add to
his safety. He must convey his peaceful intentions at
once.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>It was difficult. He dared not shout. He knew how
the voice traveled over the plains. Suddenly he remembered.
He was one of the few prairie men who still
clung to the white handkerchief of civilization. He drew
one out of his pocket. It was anything but clean, but it
would serve. Throwing up both arms he waved it furiously
at the man. This he did three times. Then, dropping
it to the ground, he held up both hands in the
manner of a prairie surrender.</p>
<p>There was a moment of anxious waiting, then, to his
relief, he saw Will head his hard blowing horse in his
direction. But still retaining his hold of his pistol, he
came on. And in those few moments before he reached
him Jim had an opportunity of close observation.</p>
<p>First he saw that the horse was nearly done. Evidently
the chase had been, if short, at least a hard one, and if the
hunters were close behind, there was little enough chance
of escape for him. The man&rsquo;s eyes were alight and staring
with the suspicious look of the hunted. His young
mouth was set desperately, and the watching man read in
his face a determination to sell his life at the highest price
he could demand. And somehow, in spite of all that had
gone, he felt a great pity for him.</p>
<p>Then, in a moment, his pity fled. It was the color of
the man&rsquo;s shirt that first caught his attention. It was
identical with his own. From this he examined the rest
of his clothing. Will Henderson was clad as much like
himself as possible. And the meaning of it was quite
plain to him.</p>
<p>The horseman came up. He flung himself back in the
saddle and reined his horse up with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely, still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
gripping the threatening revolver, as Jim dropped his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to warn you&ndash;&ndash;but my horse foundered.
See.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim pointed at the dejected beast. &ldquo;I came because
she asked me to come,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Will glanced back up the hill. It needed little enough
imagination to guess what he was looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the game&rsquo;s up, and&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m hunted. They&rsquo;re
about three miles behind&ndash;&ndash;all except one.&rdquo; He laughed
harshly. Then he caught Jim&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You came because
she sent you? That means you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to help
me, I guess, but only&ndash;&ndash;because she sent you. Are you
goin&rsquo; to?&rdquo; He edged his gun forward so that the other
could not miss seeing it.</p>
<p>But Jim had no fear. He was thinking with all the
power of his brain. Time was everything. He doubted
they had more than five minutes. He knew this patch
of country by heart, which was one of the reasons he
had taken the northern trail. Now his knowledge served
him.</p>
<p>He answered instantly, utterly ignoring the threatening
gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now get this quickly. Your only chance is to
drop down into that river. It&rsquo;s shallow, though swift&ndash;&ndash;about
two feet to possibly two and a half. Ride down
stream for two miles. It winds tremendously, so the
others won&rsquo;t see you. You&rsquo;ll come to a thick patch of
woods on either bank. Take the left bank, and make
through the woods, north. Then keep right on to some
foot-hills about ten miles due north. Once there
you can dodge &rsquo;em, sure. Anyway it&rsquo;s up to you. Leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
&rsquo;em to me, when they come up. I&rsquo;ll do my best to put
&rsquo;em off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s voice was cold enough, but he spoke rapidly.
Will, who had turned again to scan the sky-line, now
looked down at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this bluff&ndash;&ndash;or straight business?&rdquo; he demanded
harshly.</p>
<p>Jim shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best get on&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;re going to clear. You said
they were three miles off,&rdquo; he reminded him, in the same
cold manner.</p>
<p>Will looked back. He was still doubtful, but&ndash;&ndash;he
realized he must take the advice. He had delayed too
long now for anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sent you, eh?&rdquo; he asked, sharply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your
own doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no sympathy with&ndash;&ndash;cattle-thieves,&rdquo; Jim retorted.
&ldquo;Git, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were on the horizon now. And it was his
alert look that finally decided the doubting man. He
swung his horse round, and rode for the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he called back. But there was no word of
thanks. Neither had the other any response to his farewell.</p>
<p>Jim watched him till he disappeared, then he turned
again to the rising grassland and watched for the coming
of the hunters. And as he watched his thoughts reverted
to the doctrine of the one-way trail. Will was traveling
it hard. For him there was certainly no turning back
now.</p>
<p>But his horse had ceased grazing again, and once more
stood with ears pricked, gazing up the slope. Its master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
understood. This was no moment to consider abstract
problems, however they might interest him. Stern reality
lay ahead of him, and he knew he was in for an unpleasant
time. He linked his arm through his horse&rsquo;s
reins, and, with head bent, trailed slowly up the incline,
pausing and stooping to examine the hoof-prints of Will
Henderson&rsquo;s horse, as though it were a trail he had just
discovered, and was anxious to learn its meaning. He
was thinking hard the while, and calculating his chances
when the hunters should come up.</p>
<p>While he appeared to be studying the track so closely,
he yet was watching the hill-crest ahead. He knew the
men were rapidly approaching, for the rumble of galloping
horses was quite distinct to his well-trained ears. He
wanted his intentness to be at its closest when the gang
first discovered him.</p>
<p>He had his wish. As the men topped the ridge he
was on one knee studying a clearer imprint than usual.
Doc Crombie and Smallbones, riding at the head of a
party of five men, saw him, and the latter shouted his
joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! we&rsquo;ve got him! Say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He broke off,
staring hard at the kneeling figure. The outline was
familiar. Suddenly Jim stood up, and the little man instantly
recognized him. &ldquo;Guess you lost that three-year-old
&lsquo;driver,&rsquo; Doc,&rdquo; he cried, his face alight with
malice. &ldquo;Ther&rsquo;s our man, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s Jim Thorpe. I
thought I rec&rsquo;nized him from the first, when he broke
cover. This is bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stern-faced doctor had no answer for him.
His eyes were fixed on the man, who now stood calmly
waiting for him to approach. Experienced in such matters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
as he was, he looked for the threatening gun in Jim
Thorpe&rsquo;s hand. There was none. On the contrary, the
man seemed to be waiting for them in the friendliest
spirit. There was his horse, too; why was he on foot?
It struck him that the riddle wanted more reading than
Smallbones had given it. He was not so sure he had yet
lost that three-year-old &ldquo;driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim made no change of position as they clattered up.
Smallbones was ahead, with a gun leveled as he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up! Hands up, you dogone skunk, or I&rsquo;ll
blow your roof off!&rdquo; he cried fiercely.</p>
<p>But Jim only grinned. It was not a pleasant grin,
either, for the hardware dealer&rsquo;s epithet infuriated him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a blamed fool, Smallbones,&rdquo; he said sharply.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rattled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your darned hands up, or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Doc Crombie knocked the little man&rsquo;s gun up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, push that back in its kennel,&rdquo; he cried, harshly.
&ldquo;You sure ain&rsquo;t safe with a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after seeing that his comrade obeyed him, and
permitting himself a shadowy grin at the man&rsquo;s crestfallen
air, he turned to Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal?&rdquo; he drawled questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Doc,&rdquo; said Jim, with a cheery smile. &ldquo;I
guess you saved my life. Smallbones shouldn&rsquo;t be out
without his nurse.&rdquo; Then he glanced swiftly down at
the track he had been examining. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve hit a trail
right here. It goes on down to the river, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t locate
it further. I was just going back on it a piece.
Guess you&rsquo;ve come along in the same direction. See,
here it is. A horse galloping hell-for-leather. Guess it&rsquo;s
not a lope. By the splashing of sand, I&rsquo;d say he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
racing.&rdquo; He looked fearlessly into the doctor&rsquo;s eyes, but
his heart was beating hard with guilty consciousness.
He was trying to estimate the man&rsquo;s possible attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trail we&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; the doctor said sharply.
&ldquo;Say, how long you been here?&rdquo; he inquired, glancing
at Jim&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, round about here, getting on for two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you out here for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced from the doctor to Smallbones, and then
on at the rest of the men. They were all cattlemen,
none of them were villagers. He laughed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is this an&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;inquisition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s reply rapped out tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that being the way of things, guess I&rsquo;d best tell
you first as last. You see, I got back to the village yesterday
afternoon. As maybe you know, I&rsquo;ve been out
nearly two days on the trail. Well, late last night, Elia
Marsham came to me with a yarn about a hollow in the
hills, where he said he&rsquo;d seen the rustlers at work. He
told me how to find it, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;well, I hit the trail. I hoped
to head you, and get &rsquo;em myself, but,&rdquo; with a shrug, &ldquo;I
guess I was a fool some. My plug petered out two
hours back, and I had to quit. You see he was stale at
the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this trail?&rdquo; snapped the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was way back there down the river a goodish piece,
getting a sleep by the bush, and easing my plug, when I
woke up quick. Seemed to me I heard a gunshot.
Maybe I was dreaming. Anyway I sat up and took
notice, but didn&rsquo;t see a thing. So, after a while, I got
dozing again. Then my plug started to neigh, and kept
whinnying. I got around then, guessing something was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
doing. So I started to chase up the river. Then I
found this trail. It&rsquo;s new, fresh done this morning, sure.
Guess it must have been some feller passing that worried
my horse. You say you&rsquo;re on this trail? Whose? It
isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo; as the doctor nodded. &ldquo;Then come right
on down to the river. We&rsquo;re losing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned to lead his horse away, but Smallbones
laughed. There was no mistaking the derision, the challenge
of that laugh. Jim turned again, and the look he
favored the hardware dealer with was one that did not
escape the doctor, who promptly interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re right an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s wrong, you&rsquo;ve got time in
plenty to correct him later, Jim,&rdquo; he said, in his stern
fashion. &ldquo;Meanwhiles you&rsquo;ll keep your face closed,
Smallbones, or&ndash;&ndash;light right out.&rdquo; Then he turned back to
Jim. &ldquo;Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t a heap o&rsquo; hurry now, boy, fer that feller.
His horse was nigh done,&rdquo; he went on, glancing at
the dejected creature Jim was leading. &ldquo;Done jest about
as bad as yours. An&rsquo; his plug was the same color, and
he was rigged out much as you are.&rdquo; Then his tone became
doubly harsh. &ldquo;Say, the feller we&rsquo;re chasin&rsquo; was
your build. He was so like you in cut, and his plug so like
yours, that if I put it right here to the vote I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo;
you&rsquo;d hang so quick you&rsquo;d wonder how it was done.
But then, you see, I&rsquo;ve got two eyes, an&rsquo; some elegant
savvee, which some folks ain&rsquo;t blessed with,&rdquo; with an eye
in Smallbones&rsquo; direction. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I tell you right here
ther&rsquo;s just the fact your plug is stone cold between you an&rsquo;
a rawhide rope. You jest couldn&rsquo;t be the man we&rsquo;re
chasin&rsquo; &rsquo;less you&rsquo;re capable o&rsquo; miracles. Get me? But
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do some straight talk. Not more than ten
minutes gone the feller we&rsquo;re after shot down one o&rsquo; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
boys back ther&rsquo; over the rise. That boy was on a fast
hoss, an&rsquo; was close on that all-fired Dago&rsquo;s heels. Wal,
he got it plenty, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; back to bury that honest
citizen later. Meanwhiles, ten minutes gone that rustler
got down here, an&rsquo; as you say, made that river, an&rsquo; you&ndash;&ndash;you
didn&rsquo;t see him. Get me? You&rsquo;re jest goin&rsquo; to
show me wher&rsquo; you sat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second Jim&rsquo;s heart seemed to stand still. He
was not used to lying. However, he realized only too
well how the least hesitation would surely hang him, and
he promptly nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will. Come right along.&rdquo; And he led the
way diagonally from the horseman&rsquo;s tracks, so as to strike
the river obliquely.</p>
<p>It was a silent procession, and the air was charged with
possible disaster. Jim walked ahead, his horse hanging
back and being urged forward by no very gentle kicks
from Smallbones.</p>
<p>And as he walked he thought hard. He was struggling
to remember a likely spot. He dare not choose one
where grass lay under foot. These men had eyes like
hawks for a spot on such ground. There was only one
underlay where their eyes could be fooled, and that was
under the shelter of a pine tree, where the pine-needles
prevented impress and yielded no trace of footsteps. Was
there such a spot near by? He vaguely remembered a
small cluster of such trees beside his track, but he couldn&rsquo;t
remember how far away it lay. He knew he must take
a big risk.</p>
<p>He did not hesitate, and, though slowly, he walked deliberately
in a definite direction, winding in and out the
bush. Then to his intense relief, after about five minutes&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
walking, he saw the trees he was looking for. Yes, they
were right in his track, and he remembered now skirting
them as he came along. But he was not yet clear of
trouble by any means. What was the underlay like?</p>
<p>He avoided giving any sign of his destination. That
was most important. And he was fearful lest he should
be questioned. He knew the shrewdness of the redoubtable
doctor, and he feared it. He was on his own track
now, which showed plain enough in the grass. And as
he came to the clump of pines he still kept on until he
had practically passed it. He did this purposely. It was
necessary to satisfy himself that the ground under the
trees was bare except for a thick carpet of pine-needles.
Fortune was with him for once, and he suddenly turned
and led his horse in among the trees. As he walked he
disturbed the carpet as much as he could without attracting
attention, and having come to a halt, he quickly
turned his horse about the further to disturb the underlay.
Then he flung himself into a sitting posture at the foot
of one of the trees, at the same time deliberately raising
a dust with his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the spot,&rdquo; he said, looking frankly up into the
doctor&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I must have been here somewhere
around two hours. How far have we come? A
matter of two hundred yards? Look out there. It&rsquo;s
more or less a blank outlook of trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Doc Crombie was studying the ground. Jim
sprang up and began to move round his horse, feeling the
cinchas of his saddle. He felt he could reasonably do
this, and further disturb the underlay without exciting suspicion.
It was a dreadful moment for him, for he noted
that all eyes were closely scrutinizing the ground.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>Suddenly the doctor fixed an eagle glance on his face.
Jim met it. He believed it to be the final question. But
the man gave him no satisfaction. He left him with the
uncertainty as to whether he had wholly fooled him or not.
His words were peremptory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git back an&rsquo; finish the hunt,&rdquo; he declared.
Then, &ldquo;Will that durned plug carry you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe at a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, git right on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim obeyed. It would have been madness to refuse.
But his brain was desperately busy.</p>
<p>They rode back to the river bank at the point where
the fugitive had taken to the water. Most of the men
dismounted, and, with noses to the ground, they studied
the tracks. Two or three moved along the bank vainly
endeavoring to discover the man&rsquo;s further direction; and
two of them rode across to the opposite side. But the
banks told them nothing. Their quarry had obviously
not crossed the water. A quarter of an hour was spent
thus, Jim helping all he knew; then finally Doc Crombie
called his men together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git right on,&rdquo; he declared authoritatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; inquired Smallbones. He was angry,
but looked depressed.</p>
<p>The doctor considered a moment, and the men stood
round waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll head up-stream for the hills,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;ll make that way. We&rsquo;ll divide up on either
side of the river. Guess you best take three men, Smallbones,
an&rsquo; cross over. You, Thorpe, &rsquo;ll stop with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thorpe shook his head. He saw an opportunity to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
play a big hand for Eve, and, win or lose, he meant to
play it. He would not have attempted it on a man less
keen than the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Doc,&rdquo; he said coolly, and all eyes were
at once turned upon him. Every man in the party was
at once agog with interest, for not one of them but shared
Smallbones&rsquo; suspicion in some degree, however little it
might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; Jim went on, with a great show of enthusiasm,
&ldquo;do you know this river? Well,&rdquo; as the doctor
shook his head, &ldquo;I do. That&rsquo;s why I came this trail. I
guessed if any of the rustlers were liable to hit the trail,
it &rsquo;ud be somewhere around this river. You figger he&rsquo;s
gone up-stream. I&rsquo;d gamble he&rsquo;s gone down. There&rsquo;s a
heavy timber two miles or so down-stream, and that timber
is a sheer cover right up to the hills farther north. D&rsquo;you
get me? Well, personally, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gone up-stream&ndash;&ndash;so
I hunt down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was relying on the independence of his manner
and the truth of his arguments for success, and he
achieved it even beyond his hopes. Doc Crombie&rsquo;s eyes
blazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hunt with me, Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he cried sharply.</p>
<p>But Jim was ready. This was what he was looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Doc, I&rsquo;m not out for foolishness, neither are
you. Oh, yes, I know I&rsquo;m suspected, and there&rsquo;s folks,
especially our friend Smallbones, would like to hang me
right off. Well, get busy and do the hanging, I shan&rsquo;t
resist, and you&rsquo;ll all live to regret it; that is, except Smallbones.
However, this is my point. This suspicion is on
me, and I&rsquo;ve got to clear it. I&rsquo;m a sight more interested
than any of you fellows. I believe that fellow has headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
down-stream, and I claim the right, in my own self-defense,
to follow him as far as my horse will let me. I
want to hit his trail, and I&rsquo;ll run him to earth if I have to
do it on foot. And I tell you right here you&rsquo;ve no
authority to stop me. I&rsquo;m not a vigilante, and you&rsquo;re
not a sheriff, nor even a &lsquo;deputy.&rsquo; I tell you you have
neither moral nor legal right to prevent me clearing myself
in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to get rid of us,&rdquo; snarled Smallbones.</p>
<p>Jim turned on him like a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a score to settle with you, and, small as you are,
you&rsquo;re going to get all that&rsquo;s coming to you&ndash;&ndash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get busy quick, or you won&rsquo;t have
time,&rdquo; grinned the little man, making a hideous motion
of hanging.</p>
<p>But further bickering was prevented by the doctor.
At this moment he rose almost to the greatness which
his associates claimed for him. Bitter as his feelings
were at thus openly being defied and flouted, he refused
to blind himself to the justness of the other&rsquo;s plea. He
even acquiesced with a decent grace, although he refused&ndash;&ndash;as
Jim knew he would&ndash;&ndash;to change his own
opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit your trail, boy,&rdquo; he cried, in his large, harsh voice.
&ldquo;Guess you sure got the rights of a free citizen, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;good
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode off; and Smallbones, with a venomous glance
back at the triumphant Jim, started across the river. Jim
remounted his horse and rode off down the river. He
glanced back at the retreating party with the doctor, and
sighed his relief. He felt as though he had been passing
through a lifetime of crime, and ahead lay safety.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>He did not attempt to push his tired horse faster than
a walk, but continued on until he came to the woods,
where he knew Will had sought shelter; then he off-saddled.
He had no intention of proceeding farther until
sundown.</p>
<p>He thanked his stars that he had read Doc Crombie
aright. He would never have dared to bluff a lesser man
than he.</p>
<p>And then, having seated himself for rest under a bush,
his last waking thoughts were black with the despair of
an honest man who has finally and voluntarily made it
impossible to prove his own innocence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>ANNIE</h3>
</div>
<p>Doc Crombie and his men had returned to Barnriff
after a long and fruitless hunt. Two days and two nights
they had spent on the trail. They had found the haunt
of the rustlers; they had seen the men&ndash;&ndash;at least, they
had had an excellent view of their backs; they had pursued&ndash;&ndash;and
they had lost them all four. But this was not
all. One of the boys had been shot down in his tracks
by the man they believed to be the leader of the gang.
So it was easy enough to guess their temper.</p>
<p>The doctor said little, because that was his way when
things went wrong. But the iron possessed his soul to a
degree that suggested all sorts of possibilities. And
Barnriff was a raging cauldron of fury and disappointment.
So was the entire district, for the news was
abroad, travelling with that rapidity which is ever the
case with the news of disaster. Every rancher was, to
use a local phrase, &ldquo;up in the air, and tearing his sky-piece&rdquo;
(his hair), which surely meant that before long
there would be trouble for some one, the nature of which
would be quite easy to guess.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;hanging committee,&rdquo; as the vigilantes were
locally called, returned at sundown, and the evening was
spent in spreading the news. Thus it was that Annie
Gay learned the public feeling, and the general drift of
Barnriff&rsquo;s thought. Her husband dutifully gave her his
own opinions first, that there might be no doubt in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
own mind; then he proceeded to show her how Barnriff
saw these things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What ken you expect wi&rsquo;
folk like Smallbones an&rsquo; sech on a committee like this!
Doc&rsquo;s to blame, sure. Ef he&rsquo;d sed to me, &lsquo;Gay, you fix
this yer racket. I leave it to you,&rsquo; I&rsquo;d sure &rsquo;a&rsquo; got <i>men</i> in
the gang, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; cleared the country of all sech gophers
as rustlers. But ther&rsquo;, guess I don&rsquo;t need to tell
you &rsquo;bout Doc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie&rsquo;s loyalty to him stood the test, and she waited
for the rest. It came with his recounting of the details
of their exploits. He told her of their journey, of the
race. Then he passed on to the story of the Little Bluff
River, as he had been told it by Smallbones. He assured
her that now everybody, urged on by Smallbones, wanted
to hang somebody, and, as far as he could make out, unless
they quickly laid hands on the real culprit, Jim
Thorpe was likely violently to terminate his checkered
career over the one-way trail.</p>
<p>He was convinced that the venom of Smallbones, added
to the tongues of the women, which were beginning to
wag loudly at what they believed was Jim&rsquo;s clandestine
intimacy with Eve during her husband&rsquo;s absence, would
finally overcome the scruples of Doc Crombie and force
him to yield to the popular cry.</p>
<p>He gave her much detail, all of which she added to
her own knowledge. And, with her husband&rsquo;s approval,
decided to go to Eve, and, in her own phraseology, &ldquo;do
what she could.&rdquo; Her husband really sent her, for he
liked Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>So, on the third morning, Annie set out on her errand
of kindly warning. The position was difficult. But she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
realized that this was no time to let her feelings hinder
her. She loved Eve, and, like her husband, she had a
great friendliness for Jim.</p>
<p>Then she was convinced that there was nothing between
these two yet, other than had always existed, a
liking on the woman&rsquo;s part and a deep, wholesome, self-sacrificing
love on the man&rsquo;s. She saw the danger for
Eve well enough, since her husband had turned out so
badly; but her sympathetic heart went out to her, and
she would never have opened her mouth to say one word
to her detriment, even if she knew the women&rsquo;s accusations
to be true. In fact, in a wave of sentimental
emotion, she rather hoped they were true. Eve deserved
a little happiness, and, if it lay in her power to help her
to any, she would certainly not hesitate to offer her
services.</p>
<p>To Eve, fighting her lonely battle in the solitude of
her small home, amidst the cloth and trimmings of her
trade, the sight of Annie&rsquo;s cheerful, friendly face always
had a rousing effect. She lived from day to day in a
world of grinding fear. Her mind was never clear of it
now. And she clung to her work as being the only possible
thing. She dared not go out more than she was
actually obliged for fear of hearing the news she dreaded.
There was nothing to be done but wait for the sword to
fall.</p>
<p>But these last three days her fears had been divided,
and she found herself torn in two different directions by
them. Where before it had always been her husband,
now, ever since the night of Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s going, he was
rarely out of her thoughts. Now, even more than at the
time when she first understood the sacrifice he was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
to make for her. And the nobleness of it appealed to
her simple woman&rsquo;s mind as something sublime. He
was a branded man before, but now, so long as he remained
in Barnriff, or wherever he met a man who had
lived in Barnriff at this time, so long as Will escaped capture,
the pointing finger would be able to mark honest
Jim Thorpe as a&ndash;&ndash;cattle-thief. He was powerless to do
more than deny it. The horror of it was dreadful.</p>
<p>He had done it for her. And her woman&rsquo;s heart told
her why. Her thoughts flew back to those days, such a
little way back, yet, to her, so far, far away, when his
kind serious eyes used to look into hers in their gentle
caressing fashion, when his unready tongue used to halt
over speaking those nice things a woman, in her simple
vanity, loves to hear from a man she likes. She thought
of the little presents he used to make her so awkwardly,
all prompted by his great, golden, loving heart.</p>
<p>And she had passed him by for that other. The man
with the ready, specious tongue, with the buoyant, self-satisfied
air, with the bright, merry eyes of one who
knows his power with women, who rarely fails to win,
and, having won easily, no longer cares for his plaything.
But she had loved Will then, and had Jim been an angel
sent straight from heaven he could not then have taken
her from him.</p>
<p>But now? Ah, well, now everything was different.
She was older. She was, perhaps, sadly wiser. She was
also married, and Jim was, could be, nothing to her.
His nobleness to her was the nobleness which was not
the result of a selfish love that looks and hopes for its reward,
she told herself. It was part of the man. He
would have acted that way whatever his feelings for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
He was a great, loyal friend, she told herself again and
again, and her feeling for him was friendliness, a friendliness
she thanked God for, and nothing more. She told
herself all this, as many a woman has told herself before,
and she fancied, as many another good and virtuous
woman has fancied, that she believed it.</p>
<p>When Annie entered her workroom she looked up
with a wistful smile of welcome, but the sight of the
clouds obscuring the sunshine of the girl&rsquo;s face stopped
her sewing-machine at once, and ready sympathy found
prompt expression in her gentle voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;You look&ndash;&ndash;you
look as if you, too, were in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie tried to smile back in response. But it was a
poor attempt. She had been thinking so hard on her
way to Eve. She had been calculating and figuring so
keenly in her woman&rsquo;s way. And curiously enough she
had managed to make the addition of two and two into
four. She felt that she must not hesitate now, or the
courage to display the accuracy of her calculation, and
at the same time help her friend, would evaporate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; she echoed absently. &ldquo;Trouble enough
for sure, but not for me, Eve,&rdquo; she stepped round to the
girl&rsquo;s side and laid a protecting arm about her shoulders.
&ldquo;You can quit those fears you once told me of. I&ndash;&ndash;think
he&rsquo;s safe away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Annie needed confirmation of her deductive logic
she had it. The look of absolute horror which suddenly
leaped into Eve&rsquo;s drawn face was overwhelming. Annie&rsquo;s
arm tightened round her shoulders, for she thought the
distraught woman was about to faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word, Eve, dear. Don&rsquo;t you&ndash;&ndash;now don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do the talking. But first
I&rsquo;ll just shut the door.&rdquo; She crossed to the door, speaking
as she went. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to sit an&rsquo; listen, while
I tell you all about it. An&rsquo; when we&rsquo;ve finished, dear,&rdquo;
she said, coming back to her place beside her, &ldquo;ther&rsquo;s
just one thing, an&rsquo; only one person we&rsquo;ve got to think
an&rsquo; speak about. It&rsquo;s Jim Thorpe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie&rsquo;s intuition must have been something approaching
the abnormal, for she gave Eve no chance whatever
to reply. She promptly sat down at the table, and, gazing
straight into the stricken woman&rsquo;s face, told her all
that her husband had told her, and all that she had
gleaned for herself, elsewhere. She linked everything
together in such a manner as to carry absolute conviction,
showing the jeopardy in which Jim stood.</p>
<p>Never once did she refer to Will, or hint again that she
had discovered Eve&rsquo;s secret, the secret which Doc Crombie
and the whole of Barnriff would have given worlds to
possess, but she told her story from the point of view of
Jim&rsquo;s peril as a suspected cattle-thief, and his apparent
interest in her, Eve, which the whole of the village
women were beginning so virtuously to resent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if all that wasn&rsquo;t sufficient to set a wretched lot o&rsquo;
scallywags hanging him, along comes this business of the
Little Bluff River,&rdquo; she finished up.</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s face was a study in emotion during the girl&rsquo;s
recital. From terror it passed to indignation, from horror
to the shrinking of outraged wifehood. Now she stammered
her request for Annie to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;what has
that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it got to do with it?&rdquo; cried Annie, with hot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
anger at the thought. &ldquo;Why, just this. It&rsquo;s that mean
Smallbones for sure. It&rsquo;s him at the bottom of it.
They&rsquo;re saying that Jim did see the rustler, an&rsquo; helped
him get clear away while he pretended to be chasin&rsquo; him.
That&rsquo;s what the mildest of &rsquo;em sez. But ther&rsquo;s others
swear, an&rsquo; Smallbones is one of &rsquo;em, that Jim himself was
the rustler, an&rsquo; they rec&rsquo;nized him from the start. But
someways he jest managed to fool Doc, &rsquo;cause his horse
was cool, and didn&rsquo;t show no signs of the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s pretty eyes were wide with anger at these
accusers. But her anger was nothing to compare with
the fury which now stirred Eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re wicked, cruel monsters! They hate him,
and they only want to hang him because they hate him.
It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s nothing to do with the cattle stealing. Smallbones
has always hated Jim, because&ndash;&ndash;because Jim&rsquo;s
better educated and comes from good people. Jim a
cattle-thief? Jim wouldn&rsquo;t steal a&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;blade of grass.
He&rsquo;s too noble, and good, and&ndash;&ndash;and honest. Oh, I hate
these people! I hate them all&ndash;&ndash;all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie sat aghast at the storm she had roused. But
her woman&rsquo;s wit at once told her the nature of the real
feeling underlying the girl&rsquo;s words. She had suspected
before, but now she understood what, perhaps, Eve herself
had no definite understanding of. With the wrecking
of her love for her husband it had been salved and
safely anchored elsewhere. And Jim was the man who
had&ndash;&ndash;anchored it.</p>
<p>However, she wisely refrained from revealing her discovery.
She was delighted, sentimentally, foolishly delighted,
but unhesitatingly continued with the purpose of
her coming.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she agreed, nodding her pretty head
sagely. &ldquo;And so do I. But we&rsquo;ve sure got to think of
Jim Thorpe. And&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;s why I came along. Gay
knows why I came, too. You know how queer Gay is
&rsquo;bout some things. He said to me, &lsquo;You best get along.
Y&rsquo;see, I got Jim down fer buryin&rsquo; proper when his time
comes, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t figger to get fooled by any low-down
hanging.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what Gay said, an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t think it
quite elegant of him at the time. But there,&rdquo; with a
sigh, &ldquo;men are curious folk &rsquo;bout things. Still,&rdquo; she
bustled on alertly, &ldquo;we got to give him warning. We
got to make him keep away for a while anyway. He
hasn&rsquo;t been seen in the village since, and there&rsquo;s folks say
we ain&rsquo;t likely to see him again. I&ndash;&ndash;I almost hope
they&rsquo;re right, for his sake. It won&rsquo;t never do for him to
come along&ndash;&ndash;true&ndash;&ndash;true it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s earnestness and alarm were reflected in Eve&rsquo;s
face. She saw the necessity, the emergency. But how&ndash;&ndash;how
to get word to him? That was the difficulty.
How? Neither of them knew where he was, and certainly
none of the villagers did.</p>
<p>Eve shook her head desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to think,&rdquo; she said piteously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done so much thinking, and&ndash;&ndash;and scheming,
that my head feels silly, and I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t know what
to suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Annie was paying only slight attention. Now her
round eyes suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s Peter
Blunt. He&rsquo;s sure to know where Jim is, or be able to
find him. Yes, and there&rsquo;s your Elia&ndash;&ndash;if Peter fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve shook her head at the latter suggestion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, yes. He&rsquo;ll help us, surely. But we must not
think of Elia. He&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s too&ndash;&ndash;delicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s Peter,&rdquo; cried Annie, impulsively. &ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll find Peter some time
to-day, and&ndash;&ndash;and tell him to come along and see you
to-night, after dark. You see,&rdquo; she added naively, &ldquo;he
best not be seen visitin&rsquo; you in daylight. Then you can
tell him all I&rsquo;ve told you, and he&rsquo;ll sure know the best to
do. He likes Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed Eve, brightening visibly and catching
something of Annie&rsquo;s confidence in her scheme.
&ldquo;Peter will help me, I know. Oh, Annie, you are a dear,
good thing! I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d get through all this
without you. But&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll be secret, won&rsquo;t you,
dear? You see, I&rsquo;m quite helpless, and&ndash;&ndash;and you know
so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust me, Eve, you can trust me like you
can trust&ndash;&ndash;Jim Thorpe. Good-bye, dear, an&rsquo; keep
bright. I&rsquo;ll come along after you&rsquo;ve seen Peter. Yes,
we&rsquo;ve got to help Jim out&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s how my man said,
too. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurriedly kissed her friend and bustled out of the
house. All this scheming had got hold of her busy
brain, and she was eager to get to work on it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>WILL</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a long day of suspense for Eve. There was so
little to distract her mind from the things which troubled.
A few household duties, that was all. There was Elia&rsquo;s
food to be prepared when he came in from Peter&rsquo;s new
cutting, just outside the village limits. There was her
dressmaking. But this last left her so much room for
thought, and only helped to lengthen the dragging hours.</p>
<p>At dinner-time Elia informed her that there were some
jack-rabbits in a bluff just outside the village, and declared
his intention of snaring them for her that night. But she
paid only the slightest attention to him, and gave him
permission to go almost without thinking. Since Will
had escaped there was only one thing of any consequence.
It was Jim&rsquo;s safety from the angry villagers.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as she sat over her work, he alone
occupied her thoughts and troubled her to a degree that
would have startled her had she been less concerned in
his danger. She saw now how the cowardly part she
had played in accepting his help to save her worthless
husband had thrown the burden of his crime upon Jim&rsquo;s
willing shoulders. And now they wanted to hang him.
She was to blame and she alone. She who would not
willingly hurt one hair of his head.</p>
<p>Hurt him? Oh, no, no! And yet, how she had hurt
him already. She had never meant to. It had been
rushed upon her. She had acted upon the impulse of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
the moment. And then&ndash;&ndash;then he had refused to listen
when she realized the meaning of what she had done.
Hurt him? No. Now she felt that nothing else mattered
if only she could see a way to clear his name.</p>
<p>She thought long and hopelessly. Then, of a sudden,
she sprang to her feet with a cry. Yes, yes, there was a
way. They should not hang him. She still had it in
her power to save him. She still had it in her power to
tell the whole miserable, pitiful truth. She had been
a coward, but she would be a coward no longer. This
was for Jim. The other had been for herself. Yes, she
would tell the truth. She would tell them that Will
Henderson&ndash;&ndash;her husband&ndash;&ndash;was the thief. They would
believe&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But her hope suddenly dropped from her. Would
they believe? She remembered what Annie had told
her. She had been seen with Jim several times in the
village since he had left McLagan&rsquo;s. How many times?
Once&ndash;&ndash;twice&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Yes, three times in all. And already
the women of the place had started scandalous
stories. Would they believe her? If she denounced
Will, what then? Their retort would promptly be that
she was trying to rid herself of her husband, for&ndash;&ndash;her
own ends. Oh, it was cruel!</p>
<p>She flung herself into her chair, and buried her face
in her hands. She could do nothing. Nothing but wait
for help from others. And God alone knew into what
trouble she might not plunge them.</p>
<p>But gradually she became calmer. She began to think
in a different channel. She was thinking of these
scandalous tongues, and searching for an answer to them.
She began to question her feelings. She told herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
that Jim was nothing but a friend. A well-liked friend.
She told herself this several times, and thought she
believed it. Why should it be otherwise? She had
only seen him three times since he came in from
McLagan&rsquo;s. So why should it be otherwise? No, it
was not otherwise.</p>
<p>Slowly, as she thought, and the hours drifted on, her
fears fell away into the background. Her heart grew
very tender, and her denial less decided. She wondered
where Jim was. She longed to go to him. She would
have loved to carry the warning to him herself. Somehow,
she wanted to be at his side, to tell him all she
felt at the trouble she had brought upon him. At the
wrong she had so thoughtlessly, unintentionally done
him. She wanted to show him how she had only done
as her weak woman&rsquo;s conscience had prompted her.
She had not thought beyond what she believed to be
her duty. She had not paused to think what trouble
she was bringing on others&ndash;&ndash;on him. Had she only
realized at the time, that, with all her might, she was
driving the searing brand deeper into his flesh, she
would rather have faced the rope herself. She wanted
to tell him all this, to open her heart to him, and let him
see that she was not the cruel, selfish creature he must
think her for having accepted his sacrifice in bearing the
warning to Will.</p>
<p>The fascination of her self-abnegating thought held
her, and she drifted on to more personal details. She
pictured his kind eyes, and heard his deep, gentle voice
telling her that he forgave her, that he preferred to carry
the warning rather than she should suffer. She felt in
her heart that this was what he would say, for she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
knew, as most women know these things, that the old
love of a year ago was still as it was then. And the
thought of it was sweet and comforting now in her
trouble.</p>
<p>She remained in her wondrously seductive dreamland
while the minutes crept on. And, as the dusky shadows
of evening gathered, she sat silent in her woman&rsquo;s dream
of the man. It was gentle, soothing, irresistible. It
was the natural reaction after long hours of mental struggle,
when a merciful Providence brings relief to the
suffering mind, the saving sedative of a few restful moments
in the realms of a gentle dreaming of subconsciousness.</p>
<p>But perhaps this respite was something in the nature
of an inversion of the tempering of the wind. Perhaps
a strange Providence was giving her a few moments in
which to strengthen herself for the blow that was to
follow so quickly. It is of small consequence, however.
These things pass in a lifetime almost unobserved. It is
only on subsequent reflection that they become apparent.</p>
<p>The darkness had closed down, and for once the
usually brilliant summer evening was clouded, and the
twilight quickly lost. The woman&rsquo;s introspective gaze
was smiling, the drawn lines about her pretty mouth,
the shadows under her eyes seemed to have fallen from
her. It almost seemed as though the happiness of her
dreams had entirely banished the trouble that had so
long weighed her down.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the latch of her door lifted with a
rattle. She started at once into perfect consciousness.
At last. It was Peter Blunt come with his ready help.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
She started to her feet, all her dream-castles tumbling
about her. The door was pushed roughly open, and
Will, her husband, came hurriedly in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s exclamation was the last thing in horror, the
last thing in unconscious detestation. But his eyes held
hers as one fascinated by the eyes of some cruel reptile.
Nor was it until he nodded his reply that the spell was
broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and I guess you ain&rsquo;t too pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a harsh sarcasm in his tone, which added to
the steely horror in the woman&rsquo;s heart. Now her eyes
glanced swiftly over his body. He was dressed differently
to anything she had ever seen him in. He was
wearing a suit of store clothes, and a soft cotton shirt
with a collar. His whole appearance suggested the Sunday
costume of any of the villagers, which they generally
wore when setting out on a visit to a town of
some importance. Just for a moment she wondered if
this was Will&rsquo;s intention. Was he about to make a bolt
out of the country?</p>
<p>He shut the door carefully, and glanced round the
darkened room. There was just sufficient glow from the
stove to tell him there was no one else in the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Elia? Are you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was peremptory and suspicious. His furtive
eyes told Eve that he was apprehensive. She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elia&rsquo;s gone snaring jack-rabbits on the bluff, out
back,&rdquo; she said unsuspiciously. &ldquo;Shall I light a lamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  His negative came emphatically.</p>
<p>He came round to the stove, and stood looking down
at her for some moments. There was a dark, sullen frown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
in his eyes which might well have suggested possibilities
to the most unsuspicious. But she was not suspicious,
just then. She was wondering and fearful that he had returned
to the village instead of getting away. Why had
he come? she asked herself. But her question found no
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said at last, with such a sneer that she
lifted a pair of startled eyes to his face. Her heart was
hammering in her bosom. She had suddenly realized his
temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get out.
I came in for money. Have you got any of my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good. You&rsquo;re more use than I thought you.
How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over a thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s voice was icy. Her whole attitude seemed almost
mechanical. Yet a wild terror was slowly creeping over
her, mounting steadily to her brain. Nor was the reason
for it quite apparent yet.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and for a moment his frown
lightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. You can hand it over.&rdquo; And his voice was
almost friendly.</p>
<p>Eve went into her bedroom and returned with a pile of
bills. Will held out his hand for them, but she ignored it,
and laid them on the table. He seized upon them
greedily, glancing queerly at her as he pocketed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;now I can get busy.&rdquo;
He lifted his eyes to his wife&rsquo;s face again, and stared at
her malevolently, and the woman shivered under his
scrutiny. She had shrunk from coming into contact with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
the hand that had shot down one of the boys, and now
she was thinking of this man as the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best go,&rdquo; she said, vainly trying to keep her
voice steady.</p>
<p>But the man made no move. His malevolent stare had
become more intense. Suddenly he laughed, his teeth
baring, but his eyes remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, eh?&rdquo; he said. Then the malevolence of
his eyes changed to an angry fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going sure, but
not till I&rsquo;ve done what I came to do. Y&rsquo;see, there&rsquo;s no
great hurry. Folks aren&rsquo;t chasin&rsquo; me here. Here, I&rsquo;m a
respectable, hard-working gold prospector. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
been down at the saloon an&rsquo; talked with the folks. Bluff,
eh? Gold prospector. Gee! We know differently, eh?
Don&rsquo;t we? Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;when it suits me. Not
when it suits you. Guess you&rsquo;d be glad to be rid of
me, eh? So it would leave room for Jim Thorpe. Oh,
I&rsquo;ve heard. All the folks are talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started. An angry flush slowly mounted to
her cheeks, and a sudden sparkle lit her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he don&rsquo;t cut any ice with me,&rdquo; the man went on
with a laugh. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get him. Nor will any other
woman. They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to hang him. Say, what was his
price for riding out to me? Did you pay it beforehand,
or do you reckon to pay it before they hang him?
Ha, ha! guess you ain&rsquo;t paid it yet. Men don&rsquo;t work
for women after they get their pay. I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re
shrewd enough someways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s fury at the man&rsquo;s loathsome suggestion drove
her beyond all caution. And she flung her answer at
him with a hatred that was wholly infuriating to the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You best go. Remember, I know the truth of you,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve saved you from the rope, once. I still
have it in my power to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped up to her and stood, his face within a few
inches of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, is it? You&rsquo;d give me away. You!&rdquo;
He shook his head slowly, all his purpose plainly written
in his furious eyes. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give me away. I&rsquo;ll see
to that. For two pins I&rsquo;d silence you now, only&ndash;&ndash;only it
isn&rsquo;t what I want. But don&rsquo;t make a mistake, you won&rsquo;t
give me away. Sit down. Sit down right there in the
chair behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood over her, compelling her with the force behind
his command, and the terrified woman found herself
obeying him against her will. She almost fell into the
chair. Then the man turned back to the door and secured
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any one buttin&rsquo; in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to do a big talk first, then I get goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back and stood beside the stove, opposite
her, so that he could look right down into her face and
watch the effect of his words. He was brimful of a
merciless project, which was to be carried out partly for
her edification, partly for his own revenge, and wholly
for the satisfaction of the devilish nature within him,
which now, let fully loose, swayed him beyond any
thought of consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you&rsquo;ve been my Jonah right along. I
never had a cent&rsquo;s worth of luck since I got scratching
around your fence,&rdquo; he began, almost quietly. Only was
the threat in his eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t guess I can say just how
things happened&ndash;&ndash;I mean how things got going wrong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
with me, unless it was you. I&rsquo;m going to tell you
straight when it happened. I got mean when I was fool
enough to guess I was sweet on you. Jim Thorpe was
sweet on you too. I got mean toward him. We shot a
target for first chance to ask you to marry. He won. I
got in ahead, and, like a fool, married you. That was
the beginning. An&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t feel any less mean after.
Yes, you were my Jonah, sure. I couldn&rsquo;t work those
first days &rsquo;cos of you, an&rsquo; after I didn&rsquo;t guess I wanted to.
But it set me savage I didn&rsquo;t want to. Well, I&rsquo;m not
here to tell you all the things that followed. You know
them as well as me. But there&rsquo;s things you don&rsquo;t know.
After you got hurt that night it was Peter Blunt who
drove me out of Barnriff with threats of kicking me out, and
setting the townsfolk on me for the way I&rsquo;d treated you.
But Jim was behind it. He didn&rsquo;t do the talkin&rsquo; to me&ndash;&ndash;Peter
did that. But Jim came in that night to see you.
I found that out. Say, I was mad. I was mad at Jim
Thorpe, and not Peter, for I read his doing in my own
way. Y&rsquo;see I was still a fool, an&rsquo; still sweet on you. But
I saw how I could get back on him. I&rsquo;d been at work
some time on the cattle-duffing, an&rsquo; I saw just how I
could hurt him too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, cattle-duffing&rsquo;s a great gambol, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t regret
it. I&rsquo;m going to keep on at it&ndash;&ndash;only elsewhere. Well,
I got hold of Master Jim&rsquo;s brand. I got kit as like he
wears as two cents, in case I was located. We&rsquo;re alike
in figure&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, thank God, there&rsquo;s no other resemblance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s scathing comment came with startling suddenness.
Her terror was passing, and only she felt a great
loathing for this man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep all that till I&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo; Will said coolly.
&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t be so ready then. Well, I used his
brand, and set a bunch of cattle running amongst his&ndash;&ndash;McLagan&rsquo;s
cattle, as you know. Then I waited for developments.
They came&ndash;&ndash;oh, yes, they came. Jim was
the cattle-thief. I the lucky gold prospector. Good,
eh?&rdquo; He laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, I was still a fool,&rdquo; he went on, after a slight
pause. &ldquo;I was still sweet on you. Then I heard every
time Jim came into the village he&rsquo;d always call to see
you. That set me mad&ndash;&ndash;so mad you came mighty near
to passing in your checks, and Jim too. I&rsquo;m glad those
things didn&rsquo;t happen now. Y&rsquo;see, I didn&rsquo;t reckon on
Elia. I&rsquo;d forgotten him. That imp of hell can hate,
and it was me he hated, eh? Y&rsquo;see, I&rsquo;ve heard how he
tracked me. I hear most things doing in Barnriff. Then
you did your fool stunt sending Jim out to warn me.
He got me clear, and&ndash;&ndash;and I hate him worse for it; but
not so bad as I hate you now. I see how it was done.
I&rsquo;m no fool. Jim did it for you, and I guess you&rsquo;ll pay
his price. That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re both thinking. But you
won&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to hang him. There&rsquo;s only one
person who can put them wise about this cattle stealing,
that&rsquo;s Elia. And I&rsquo;m going to kill him to-night. That&rsquo;s
why I came in&ndash;&ndash;that an&rsquo; to get money. When I&rsquo;ve
finished him I&rsquo;ll see to you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve was on her feet in a frenzy of horror and fear
for the brother she loved. All her mother&rsquo;s instinct was
roused to a fighting pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t touch him!&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;You
shall kill me first! I swear it! Oh, you wretched murderer!
You filth! Ha, ha&ndash;&ndash;nobody but Elia knows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Peter knows, and&ndash;&ndash;and others. You touch Elia, and I
swear you shan&rsquo;t escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter knows, eh? Ho, ho, my girl,&rdquo; the man mocked.
Then he shook his head. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter&ndash;&ndash;not a little
bit. What I&rsquo;m going to do will be done to-night. Elia
will get his med&rsquo;cine, and then I&rsquo;ll come back, and&ndash;&ndash;well,
you shan&rsquo;t get a chance of paying Jim his price. Oh,
no,&rdquo; as Eve opened her lips to speak again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no
chances. I&rsquo;ll leave you safe here. I could settle you
first, but I want you to know your beloved brother is
dead before&ndash;&ndash;you join him. Get my meaning? You
see, Peter and those others knowing have altered my
plans some. You&rsquo;ll join your angel brother when I come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been bending over her, to impress his cruel
words upon her more forcibly. Now he suddenly
straightened up and snatched some dress material from
the table. Before the wretched woman was aware of his
intentions he had flung it over her head. She tried to
scream, but instantly he had her by the throat with one
hand and choked her cries back. With the other he
thrust the cloth into her mouth till she was effectually
gagged. Then he secured it in place with a long binding
of braid. But the moment this was done, and he
released her throat, she began to struggle violently, and
he was forced to exert all his strength to crush her down
into the chair. Here he knelt on her, while he lashed
her hands together, and then her feet. Then he tied the
two bindings together, so that her arms were locked immovable
round her knees. Now, at his leisure, he took
the table cover and securely bound her into the chair.</p>
<p>This accomplished, he stood up and surveyed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
handiwork carefully. He was breathing hard with his
exertion. Yes, she was well secured, and he smiled sardonically.
He watched her thus for some moments.
Then he glanced round the darkened room. It was
the haunted look of the man engaged in crime.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stepped softly to her side, and, stooping,
lifted the cloth with which she was gagged from before
the upper part of her face. He looked into the hunted,
terrified eyes and grinned. Then he put his lips close to
one of her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to the bluff out back to&ndash;&ndash;kill your
brother, your beloved Elia. Then I&rsquo;m coming back to&ndash;&ndash;kill
you,&rdquo; he whispered. And the next moment he was
gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>JIM</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with no very cheerful feelings that Jim Thorpe
approached Barnriff once more. He had delayed his return
as long as possible, not from any fear for himself,
but for the sake of giving color to his final protestations
to Doc Crombie, when they parted company at the Little
Bluff River.</p>
<p>After resting his horse in the river woods for a full
twenty-four hours&ndash;&ndash;and, in that time, the tough beast had
fully recovered from his journey&ndash;&ndash;he then, with simple
strategy, hunted up Will&rsquo;s tracks where the fugitive had
left the river, and steadily trailed him to the northern
hills. There he gave up further pursuit, having fully
satisfied himself that the man&rsquo;s escape had been accomplished.
So he turned his horse&rsquo;s head toward Barnriff,
and prepared himself to face the trouble that he knew
would be awaiting him.</p>
<p>It was a cheerless journey, harassed by thoughts and
speculations that could be hardly considered illuminating.
Curiously enough he had no thought of making a run for
it to a district where he was still unknown. Why should
he? There was not a guilty thought in his mind, unless
it were the recollection of the trick he had played on the
lynching party to save Will from the rope.</p>
<p>No, his set purpose was to return to Barnriff and fight
the public feeling he knew there was against him, and to
live it down. Besides, there was Eve. Who could tell,
with such a husband as Will, when she might not need
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
the help of a strong, willing arm? His love for her was
stronger than his discretion, it was more powerful than
any selfish consideration.</p>
<p>He had but one real friend in Barnriff that he knew of.
There were several, he believed, who, at a crisis, would
vote in his favor, but that was all. Peter Blunt he knew
he could rely on to the last. And, somehow, this man,
to his mind, was an even more powerful factor than Doc
Crombie. It was not that Peter held any great appeal
with the people, but somehow there was a reserve of
mental strength in the man that lifted him far above his
fellows, in his capacity to do in emergency. He felt
that, with the great shadow of Peter standing by, he had
little to fear from such jackals as Smallbones.</p>
<p>Yet the outlook was depressing enough as he drew
near his destination. He no longer had the possibility
of clearing his name. That was past. A hope abandoned
with many others in his short life. All thought
of establishing his innocence must be wiped out forever.
He had enlisted himself in Eve&rsquo;s service for good or evil,
and the only thing remaining to him was, by facing the
yelping of the Barnriff pack, with a dogged, defiant front,
to attempt to live down his disgrace. In this, to his
simple mind, there was one great thing in his favor.
The cattle stealing was at an end. There would be no
further depredations. And this alone would be of incalculable
help to him. He knew the cattle world well
enough to understand that the ethics of the case were
not of paramount importance with these people. It was
the loss of stock which rankled. It was the definite,
material loss and injury to the commerce of the district.</p>
<p>But to a man of his honor and love of fair play the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
position was desperately hard. Fate was driving him at
a pace that threatened to wreck in no uncertain manner.
The downward path looked so easy&ndash;&ndash;was so easy.
Lately he had frequently found himself wondering why
he didn&rsquo;t go with the tide and head straight for the
vortex that he felt would be only too ready to engulf
him. He had been so near it once. That moment was
indelibly fixed on his memory. He doubted that but for
Peter Blunt he would never have resisted the temptation.
He knew himself, he was honest with himself. That day
when he first discovered Will&rsquo;s treachery Peter had saved
him.</p>
<p>Now everything seemed somehow different. His
thoughts were frequently desperate enough, but, whereas
a year ago he would have cried out against Heaven,
against everything in Heaven or on earth, now he wanted
to set his back to the wall and fight. He felt it in him
to fight, let the odds be what they might. And he knew
that he owed this new spirit to the big-hearted Peter,
who had once shown him how wrong he was.</p>
<p>But though less acknowledged, there was another influence
at work within him. Eve was there alone, far
more alone than if she had never married Will. He
only guessed what her feelings must be, for she was still
in doubt as to Will&rsquo;s safety. Yes, he would at least have
the privilege of carrying her the glad tidings.</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly. He could not help it. Yes, she
would be the happier for his tidings, and with that he
must be content. Now, no one would ever know. Her
disgrace would be hidden, and she would be able to live
on quietly in the village with her young brother until
such time as she felt it safe to join her husband.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>Try as he would to appreciate the comparative happiness
he was conveying to the woman, he felt the sharp
pricks of the thorny burden he was bearing. He smiled
in the growing darkness, and told himself that there was
no disaster that brought happiness to any one but must
be counted as a good work.</p>
<p>He could see the twinkling lights of the village less
than half a mile ahead, and he glanced over them carefully.
There was the saloon. Who could mistake it,
with its flamboyant brilliance against the lesser twinkle
of the smaller houses? His eyes searched for the lights
of Eve&rsquo;s home. He could not see them. Possibly she
was in her kitchen, that snug little room, where, up to a
year ago, he had many a time taken tea with her. Yes,
it would be about her supper-time. He looked back at
the western sky to verify the hour. The last faint sheen
of sunset was slipping away into the soft velvet of night.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment as to his best course.
Should he wait until morning to bear his tidings to her?
No, that would leave her unnecessary time for worry and
anxiety. Best go to her to-night&ndash;&ndash;at once.</p>
<p>He shook up his horse into a better gait. It were best
to hurry. He did not want to be seen visiting her late
in the evening. He knew the scandalous tongues of the
village only too well.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he was nearing the saloon. He would
pass within fifty yards of it. As he came abreast of it he
turned his head curiously in its direction. There was a
great din of voices coming from its frowzy interior, and
he wondered. The men seemed to have begun their
nightly orgie early. Then it occurred to him that perhaps
Crombie&rsquo;s men had returned, and were out to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
a night of it. He smiled to himself. They would need
a good deal of drink to wash out the taste of the bitter
pill of Will&rsquo;s escape.</p>
<p>Had he but known it, the occasion was a meeting of
the townsmen to decide his fate. Had he but known it,
Peter Blunt was there watching his interests and ready to
fight with both brains and muscle on his behalf. But
then, had he known it, it might have altered the whole
complexion of the events which happened in Barnriff that
night.</p>
<p>He did not know it, so he rode straight on to Eve&rsquo;s
house. Nor did it occur to him as strange, at that hour
in the evening, that he did not encounter a single soul on
his way.</p>
<p>Arrived at her gate he dismounted and off-saddled. He
would not need his horse again that night, so he turned
the animal loose to graze at its leisure. It would find its
way to the water when it wanted to, and when he had
seen Eve he would carry his saddle back to Peter&rsquo;s hut,
where he was going to sleep.</p>
<p>Just for a moment he paused before opening the gate.
The house was still in darkness. He had half a mind to
go round the back and see if there were lights in the
kitchen. But it seemed like spying to him, and so he
refrained.</p>
<p>But somehow the place suggested that there was no
one within, and eventually he started up the path with a
feeling of keen disappointment. At the door he paused
and felt for the latch. Then, just as his hand came into
contact with it, and he was about to lift it, he started,
and, motionless, stood listening.</p>
<p>What was that? He thought he heard a peculiar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
moaning beyond the door. No, he was mistaken. There
was no sound now. At least&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Ah, there it was
again. He pressed one ear against the door and immediately
started back. He had not been mistaken.</p>
<p>He no longer hesitated, but, lifting the latch noisily,
pressed against the door. It was fast. And now the
moaning suddenly became louder. Without a thought,
without a scruple, he promptly thrust his toe against the
foot of the door and pressed heavily. Then, lifting the
latch, he threw all the weight of his powerful shoulder
against the lock. The door gave before him, nearly precipitating
him headlong into the room.</p>
<p>He managed to save himself and stepped hurriedly
within. Then he again stood listening. The room was
quite dark, but now he had no difficulty in placing the
moaning. It came from just across the room beside
Eve&rsquo;s stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; But as no answer
came a great fear gripped his heart. Was this a repetition
of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; No, Will was away out in the mountains.</p>
<p>Now the moaning was louder, and there was a distinct
rustling whence the sound came. He fumbled a match
from his pocket and struck it. One glance toward the
stove set him rushing across to the parlor lamp.</p>
<p>He lit the lamp and hurried back to the chair beside
the stove. He needed but one glance to realize Eve&rsquo;s
condition, and his heart was filled with a great rage.
Who? Who had done this thing? was the question that
ran through his mind as he set to work to undo the cruel
bonds that held her to her chair.</p>
<p>It was the work of a few moments to remove the gag
that was nearly choking her. Then the knots about her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
wrists and feet were swiftly undone. Released at last,
Eve sank back in a semi-fainting condition, and Jim
looked on helplessly. And in those moments he made up
his mind that some one was going to pay dearly for this.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to him that no time must be lost, so
he hurried into the kitchen and came back with a dipper
of drinking water. He held it to the girl&rsquo;s lips, and after
she had drunk he soaked his handkerchief in what remained,
and bathed her forehead and temples with a
wonderful tenderness and silent sympathy.</p>
<p>But suddenly Eve opened her eyes. And at once he
saw that her weakness had passed. The horror of recollection
was alive once more within her, and her terrified
eyes sought his. When she saw who he was she sprang
to her feet with a great cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; she cried. And, staggering in her weakness,
she would have fallen.</p>
<p>He caught her just in time, and gently returned her
to her seat. But with a great effort she overcame her
faintness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, save him!&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;Oh,
Jim, he&rsquo;s gone to kill him! Save him for me! Only
save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position was difficult. Jim&rsquo;s heart bled for the
distraught woman. But he realized that he must calm
her at once, or she would break out into shrieking hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm, Eve,&rdquo; he said almost roughly. &ldquo;How can
I understand when you talk like that? Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have
any foolishness. Now quietly. Who&rsquo;s gone to kill&ndash;&ndash;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner had its effect. Eve choked back her rising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
emotion with an effort, and her eyes lost some of their
straining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Will,&rdquo; she said, with a sort of deliberate measuring
of her words. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to kill Elia. Out there,
back at the bluff. It&rsquo;s for setting the men after him.
And&ndash;&ndash;then, and then he&rsquo;s coming back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was staggered. He looked at the woman wondering
if she had suddenly lost her senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I came back to tell you he&rsquo;d got clear away.
By Heaven! And he did this?&rdquo; He indicated the
bonds he had just removed, and his eyes darkened with
sudden fury.</p>
<p>The woman nodded. She was holding herself with all
her might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; Suddenly she let herself
go. All the old terror surged uppermost again. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t wait! Jim, save him for my sake! Save him for
me! Oh, my poor, helpless brother! Jim&ndash;&ndash;Jim, you
are the only one I can look to. Oh, save him! He&rsquo;s
all I have&ndash;&ndash;all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a dreadful moment for the man. The woman
he loved half dead with terror and the cruel handling
dealt her by her husband. Now she was appealing to him
as the only man in the world she could appeal to. His love
rushed to his head and came near to driving him to the
one thing in the world he knew he must not do. He
longed to crush her in his strong arms, and proclaim his
right to protect her against the world. He loved her so
that he wanted to defy everybody, all the world, that he
might claim her for his own. But she was not his. And
he almost spoke the words aloud to convince himself and
drive back the demon surging through his blood.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you say he was?&rdquo; he demanded, almost
savagely in his tremendous self-repression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the bluff, out back. Hurry, hurry, for&ndash;&ndash;God&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was better. The less personal appeal helped him
to calm himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s he been gone?&rdquo; he asked, turning his eyes
from her terror-stricken face to help himself regain his
own control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a quarter of an hour, or even a half,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quarter of a mile, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More. Nearly a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. You stay here.&rdquo; He threw a pistol on the
table. &ldquo;Keep that to protect yourself,&rdquo; he added,
brusquely. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;Eve, if I get there in time, I&rsquo;ll save
your brother. If I don&rsquo;t, your husband shall die, as sure
as&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his sentence remained unfinished. He rushed out
of the house and sought his horse. The animal was still
grazing near by. He slipped the bit into its mouth.
Then he sprang on to its bare back and galloped off.</p>
<p>And as he rushed out Eve fell back into a chair laughing
and crying at the same time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>WILL HENDERSON REACHES THE END</h3>
</div>
<p>Will Henderson stalked his prey with a caution, a
deliberateness, as though he were dealing with a grown
man, a man who could resist, one whose power to retaliate
was as great as was his to attack. But nothing of this
was in his thoughts. It was the fell intent to murder
that now cast its furtive, suspicious, even apprehensive
spell over his mind, and so influenced his actions.</p>
<p>As Elia at one time had trailed him, so he was now
tracking Elia. From bush to bush and shadow to shadow
he searched the bluff for the hunter of jack-rabbits. But
the bluff was extensive, the night dark, and the movements
of the snarer as silent as those of the man hunting
him. There was black murder in Will&rsquo;s heart, the cruel
purpose of a mind turned suddenly malignant with a desire
for adequate revenge. His was nothing of the fiery
rage which drives a man spontaneously. He meant to
kill his victim after he had satisfied his lust for torture,
and no one knew better than he how easy his task was,
and how cruelly he could torture this brother of Eve.</p>
<p>The starlit night yielded up the bluff a wide black patch
amidst a shadowed world. There was no moon, but the
wealth of stars shed a faint glimmer of soft light on the
surrounding plains. The conditions could not have been
more favorable for his purpose, and they gave him a
fiendish satisfaction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></div>
<p>He had skirted the bluff all round. He had passed
through its length. And still no sign of his quarry.
Twice he started up a jack-rabbit, but the snarer did not
seem to be in the vicinity. Now, with much care and
calculation, he began to traverse the breadth of the bush in
a zigzag fashion which was to continue its whole length.
His old trapping instincts served him, and none but
perhaps an Indian would have guessed that a human
being was searching every inch of the woodland
shadow.</p>
<p>The man had already traversed a third of the bush in
this fashion when the unexpected happened. For the
tenth time he approached the southern fringe of the bluff
and stood half hidden in the shadow of one of the large,
scattered bushes outlying. And in the starlight he beheld
a familiar figure out in the open, watching intently
the very spot at which he had emerged.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the figure, even in that dim
light. Did not everybody know that head, bent so deliberately
on one side? The hunched shoulders? The
drawn-up hip? It was Elia, and, in the darkness, a fierce
grin of satisfaction lit the murderer&rsquo;s face. He realized
that the snarer must have heard his approach, and, believing
it to be a jack-rabbit, had waited to make sure. The
thought tickled his cruel senses, and he wanted to laugh
aloud. But he refrained, and, instead, moved stealthily
forward.</p>
<p>The bush hid him while he had a good view of his
victim through its upper branches. And he calculated
that if the boy remained standing where he was, with a
little care he could approach to within a yard or two of
him without being discovered. So he moved forward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
circling the bush without any sound. It was wonderful
how his training as a trapper had taught him the science
of silent woodcraft.</p>
<p>As he reached the limits of his shelter he dropped upon
his stomach and began to wriggle through the grass. It
pleased him to do this. It gave him a sense of delight at
the thought of the horrible awakening the cowardly boy
was presently to receive.</p>
<p>A yard&ndash;&ndash;two yards, he slid through the grass. Three.
One more, and he would be near enough for his purpose.
Suddenly and silently he stood erect, like a figure rising
out of the ground. He was directly in front of the boy,
and within arm&rsquo;s length of him. He stood thus for a
second that his victim might realize his identity thoroughly,
and fully digest the meaning of the sudden apparition.</p>
<p>He had full satisfaction. Elia recognized him and
stood petrified with terror. So awful to him was the
meaning of that silent figure that he had not even the
power to cry out. He shook convulsively and stood
waiting.</p>
<p>The murderer raised one hand slowly and reached out
toward the boy. His hand touched his clothing, and
moved up to his throat. The powerful fingers came into
contact with the soft flesh, and closed upon it. Then it
was that the moment of paralysis passed. The boy fell
back with a terrible cry.</p>
<p>But Will followed him up, and again his hand reached
his throat. He grasped it, and tightened his fingers upon
it. A gurgling cry of abject terror was the response.
Again Will&rsquo;s hand released its hold. But now he seized
one of the boy&rsquo;s outstretched arms, and, with a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
movement, twisted it behind his back so hard that a third
cry, this time of pain alone, was wrung from the terrified
lad.</p>
<p>He held him thus and looked into the beautiful face
now so pitifully distorted with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve done the tracking this time,&rdquo; Will said
through his clenched teeth. &ldquo;You put me to a lot of
trouble coming all this way. Still, I don&rsquo;t guess I mind
much. Most folks get their med&rsquo;cine. You&rsquo;re going to
get yours to-night. How d&rsquo;you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrenched the weakly arm till the boy cried out
again, and dropped to his knees in anguish. But, with a
ruthless jolt, Will jerked him to his feet, nearly dislocating
his arm in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re squealing, now, eh? You&rsquo;re squealing,&rdquo;
he repeated, striking the boy on the hump of his back
with his clenched first. &ldquo;That hurts too, eh?&rdquo; As a
fresh cry broke from his victim. &ldquo;I always heard that
the hump was tender in a dog-ghasted cripple. Is it?
Is it?&rdquo; he inquired, at each question repeating the blow
with increased force.</p>
<p>He released his hold, and the boy fell to the ground.
He stood looking down at him with diabolical purpose in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you figgered to hand me over to the rope, eh?
You guessed you&rsquo;d stand by watching me slowly strangle,
eh? So you trailed me, and went on to Doc Crombie
and told him. Ah&ndash;&ndash;h. You like hurting things. You
like seeing folks hurt. But you&rsquo;re scared to death being
hurt yourself. That&rsquo;s how I know. I could kill you
with the grip of one hand. But it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you
enough. At least not to suit me. You must be hurt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
first. You must know what it&rsquo;s like being hurt, you
rotten, loathsome earthworm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dealt the lad a terrific kick on his sickly, sunken
chest, and a terrible cry broke the silence. It was almost
like the cry of a pig being slaughtered, so piercing and
shrill a squeak was it.</p>
<p>The noise of his cry startled his torturer. After all
they were not far from the village. Then he laughed.
A cry like that from the prairie must sound like a hungry
coyote calling to its mate. Yes, no one would recognize
it for a human cry. He would try it again.</p>
<p>He dealt the prostrate boy another furious kick, and
he had his wish. A third time the blow was repeated to
satisfy his savage lust, and he laughed aloud at the
hideous resulting cry. Again and again he kicked.
And the cries pleased him, and they sent a joyous thrill
through him at the thought of the pain the lad was suffering.
He would continue it until the cries weakened,
then he would cease for a while to let his victim recover.
Then again he would resume the fiendish kicking, and
continue it at intervals, until he had kicked the life out
of the deformed body.</p>
<p>He drew his foot back for another blow. But the
blow remained undelivered. There was a rush of horse&rsquo;s
hoofs, a clatter as they ceased, the sound of running feet,
and a smashing blow took the torturer on the side of the
jaw. He dropped like a log beside his victim. The
whole thing was the work of an instant. So swift had
come the avenging blow that, in the darkness, he had no
time to realize its coming.</p>
<p>Jim Thorpe stood over his man waiting for him to rise,
or show some sign of life. But there was neither movement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
nor apparent life in him. In the avenger&rsquo;s heart
there was a wild hope that the man was dead. He had
hit him with such a feeling in his frenzy of passion.
But he knew he had only knocked the brute out.</p>
<p>As Will remained still where he had fallen, Jim turned
away with a sigh. It would have been difficult to interpret
his sigh. Maybe it was the sigh of a man who
suddenly relaxes himself from a tremendous physical
effort; maybe it was at the thought that his momentary
desire had been accomplished; maybe it was for the poor
lad whose terrible cries were still ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Thinking only of Elia, he now dropped on his knees
beside him. There was sufficient light from the stars to
show him the lad&rsquo;s pallid upturned face and staring,
agonized eyes. In a second his arms were about his
misformed body, and he tenderly raised him up and
spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, laddie,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t hurt
too bad, are you? I got here quick as I could. Say, he
hasn&rsquo;t smashed you, has he? God! if he has!&rdquo; He
looked round at the fallen man with blazing eyes, as the
thought flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>But suddenly he felt Elia&rsquo;s body writhe, and he turned
to him again with eager words of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up, laddie,&rdquo; he said, without much conviction.
&ldquo;Guess you aren&rsquo;t smashed as bad as you think. It&rsquo;s
Jim. I&rsquo;ll look after you. He won&rsquo;t hit you again. I&rsquo;ve
fixed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia&rsquo;s staring eyes suddenly lost their tension. He
moved his head and tried to free his arms. Jim picked
him up and set him on his feet, and noted that he
breathed more freely. Yes, he had been in time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>Elia steadied himself for a moment against his arm.
He was silent, and still breathing hard. His body was
racked with fierce pain, but his poor distorted mind was
suffering greater. Jim waited patiently. He understood.
It was the awful shock that the boy, in his helpless fashion,
was struggling with.</p>
<p>Some moments passed thus, and at last the words
which Jim was waiting for came. But they shocked him
strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you kill him?&rdquo; Elia asked, with a struggle
controlling his halting tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, boy, he&rsquo;s only knocked out&ndash;&ndash;I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fule,&rdquo; whispered the lad viciously.</p>
<p>Jim had no answer to this, and the boy, recovering
slowly, spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best kill him now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a devil. He&rsquo;s
smashed me all up. He&rsquo;s smashed my sick body, and
things feel queer inside me. Kill him, Jim! Kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching the working face, the man sickened at the
inhuman desire of the boy. Where did he ever get
such a frightful nature from? It was monstrous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said almost sternly, &ldquo;can you walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo; The tone had that peculiar sullenness
which generally portended an outbreak of the most vicious
side of the boy&rsquo;s temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get over there by my horse and wait till I
come. I&rsquo;ll put you on him, and you can ride back
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demand was an eager whisper. It suggested the
hope that Jim was perhaps after all going to do as he
asked&ndash;&ndash;and kill Will Henderson.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see&ndash;&ndash;how bad Will is. Be off now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I stay&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; watch you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Get on after that horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia turned away, and Jim watched his painful gait.
Once he thought he saw him stagger, but, as he continued
to hobble on, he turned again to the injured man.
One glance at his face showed him the extent of his
handiwork. He was ripped open right along the jaw,
and the bone itself was badly broken.</p>
<p>He instantly whipped out his sheath-knife and a
handkerchief. The latter he cut up into a bandage.
Then, removing the silk scarf at his neck, he folded it
into a soft pad, and bound it over the wound. Curiously
he felt he must lend what aid he could first, and then
send out adequate help from the village.</p>
<p>He stood up, took a final glance at the wounded face,
and turned coldly away toward his horse.</p>
<p>But now events took an unexpected and disconcerting
turn. When he reached his horse Elia was nowhere to
be seen. He called, but received no answer. He called
again, but still no answer. And suddenly he became
alarmed. He remembered the boy&rsquo;s condition. He
must have collapsed somewhere.</p>
<p>He promptly began to search. Taking his horse as a
central point he moved round it in ever widening circles,
calling at intervals, and with his eyes glued to the long
grass which swished under his feet. For more than ten
minutes he searched in vain; and then, once more, he
found himself beside the man he had knocked out.</p>
<p>He was thoroughly alarmed now. Eve was still anxiously
awaiting news of her brother. The thing was
quite inexplicable. He could never have attempted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
walk home. Why should he? Finally he decided that
he must have strolled into the bush and sat down,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His glance fell upon the man lying at his feet. How
still he lay. How&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Hello, what was this? He had
left him lying on his side. Now his pale face was turned
directly up at the sky. And&ndash;&ndash;he dropped on his knees
at his side&ndash;&ndash;his bandage had been removed. He glanced
about. There it was, a yard away in the grass. In
wondering astonishment his eyes came back to the
ghastly face of the unconscious man. Somehow it
looked different, yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A glance at his body drew an exclamation of horror
from his lips. For a moment every drop of blood seemed
to recede from his brain, leaving him cold. A clammy
moisture broke out upon his forehead at what he beheld.
The man&rsquo;s clothing had been torn open leaving his
chest bare, and he now beheld his own knife plunged to
the hilt in the white flesh. Will Henderson was dead&ndash;&ndash;stabbed
through the heart by&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet with a cry of horror, and his
eyes flashed right and left as though in search of the
murderer. Who had done this thing? Who&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;? As
though in answer to his thought, Elia&rsquo;s voice reached
him from out of the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure dead. I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed a rustling of the brushwood, as though
the boy had taken himself off.</p>
<p>Jim made no attempt to follow him. He remained
staring into the black woods whence that voice had proceeded.
He was petrified with the horror of the boy&rsquo;s
deed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>He stood for some minutes thus. Then thought
became active once more. And curiously enough it
was cool, calm, and debating. The possibilities that had
so suddenly opened up were tremendous. Tremendous
and&ndash;&ndash;hideous. Yet they stirred him far less than might
have been expected. Black, foul murder had been
committed, and in a way that threw the entire blame
on himself.</p>
<p>He saw it all in a flash. It needed but the smallest
intelligence to do so. There was no mind in Barnriff
but would inevitably fix on his guilt&ndash;&ndash;even his friend
Peter. How could it be otherwise? There was his
knife. There were his handkerchiefs. The white one
had his name on it. The knife had his initials branded
on its handle. His last words to Eve had been a threat
to kill her husband.</p>
<p>And Elia had done this hideous thing. A weak,
sickly boy. It was terrible, and he shuddered. What
hatred he must have had for the dead man. He found
himself almost sympathizing with the lad&rsquo;s feelings.
Yes, Will had certainly brought this thing upon himself.
He&ndash;&ndash;deserved his fate. Yet Elia&ndash;&ndash;the thought revolted
him.</p>
<p>But suddenly a fresh significance came to him. He
had missed it before. What would this mean to Eve?
Elia&rsquo;s guilt. What would Will&rsquo;s death mean to her?
But now his thoughts ran faster. Elia&rsquo;s guilt? Eve
would never believe it. Besides, if she did it would break
her heart. The boy was something like a passion to
her. He was almost as though he were part of herself.
She loved him as though he were flesh of her own flesh.</p>
<p>No, even if it were possible to convince her, she must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
never be told. His crime must be covered up someway.
But how?</p>
<p>The man stood lost in thought for nearly half an hour.
They were the thoughts of a man who at last sees the end
of all things earthly looming heavily upon his horizon.
There was no cowardly shrinking, there was very little
regret. What he must do he felt was being forced upon
him by an invincible fate, but the sting of it was far less
poignant than would have been the case a few months
ago. In fact the sting was hardly there at all.</p>
<p>At all costs Eve must be protected. She must never
know the truth. It was bad enough that her husband
was dead. He wondered vaguely how far her love had
survived the man&rsquo;s outrages. Yes, she loved him still.
He could never forget her the night he had volunteered
to carry the warning to Will. Strange, he thought, how
a woman will cling to the man who has once possessed
her love.</p>
<p>Ah, well, he had never known the possession of such a
priceless jewel as a good woman&rsquo;s love. And now he
was never likely to have the chance, he admitted with a
simple regret. It seemed pretty hard. And yet&ndash;&ndash;he
almost smiled&ndash;&ndash;it would be all the same after a few painful
moments.</p>
<p>And only a brief hour ago he had been yearning to
fight, with his back to the wall, against the suspicion and
feeling against him in the village. He smiled with a
shadow of bitterness and shook his head. Useless&ndash;&ndash;quite
useless. The one-way trail was well marked for him, and
he had traveled it as best he knew how. As Peter said,
there were no side paths. Just a narrow road, and the
obstructions and perils on the way were set there for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
each to face. Well, he would face this last one with a
&ldquo;stiff upper-lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing he was irrevocably determined upon, never
by word or action would he add to Eve&rsquo;s unhappiness.
And, if the cruel fate that had always dogged him demanded
this final sacrifice, he would at least have the
trifling satisfaction of knowing, as he went out of the
world, that her future had been rendered the smoother
by the blow that had removed Will from his sphere of
crime.</p>
<p>He walked briskly back to his horse and leaped upon
its back. Then, turning its head, he sat for a moment
thinking. There was still a way out. Still a means of
escape without Eve&rsquo;s learning the truth. But it was a
coward&rsquo;s way, it was the way of the guilty. It was quite
simple, too. He only had to go back and withdraw the
knife from the man&rsquo;s body, and gather up the two handkerchiefs,
and&ndash;&ndash;ride away. It sounded easy; it was easy.
A new country. A fresh people who did not know him.
Another start in life. There was hope in the thought.
Yes, a little, but not much. The accusing finger would
follow him pointing, the shadow of the rope would haunt
him wherever he went in spite of his innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psha! No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and rode away toward
the village.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE DISCOMFITURE OF SMALLBONES</h3>
</div>
<p>Never in all his recollection had Silas Rocket had
such a profitable night. From sundown on, his saloon
was packed almost to suffocation, and he scarcely had
time to wipe a single glass between drinks, so rapidly
were the orders shouted across his bar. All the male
portion of Barnriff were present, with the addition of
nearly thirty men from the outlying ranges. It was a
sort of mass meeting summoned by Doc Crombie, who
had finally, but reluctantly, been driven to yield to the
public cry against Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>The doctor understood his people, and knew just how
far his authority would carry him. He had exerted that
authority to the breaking point to protect a man, whom,
in his heart, he believed to be innocent of the charges
laid at his door. But now the popular voice was too
strong for him, and he yielded with an ill-grace.</p>
<p>Smallbones was the man responsible for this rebellion
against a long-recognized authority. He was at the
bottom of the campaign against Jim Thorpe. Whether
he was himself convinced of the man&rsquo;s guilt it would have
been difficult to say. For some reason, which was
scarcely apparent, he meant to hang him. And, with all
the persistence of a venomous nature, he shouted his denunciation,
until at last his arguments gained credence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
and his charges found echo in the deep throats of
men who originally had little or nothing to say in the
matter.</p>
<p>The meeting was in full swing, tempers were roused in
proportion to the arguments flung about at haphazard,
and the quantities of liquor consumed in the process of
the debate. At first the centre of the floor had been
kept clear for the speakers, and the audience was lined
up around the walls, but as the discussion warmed there
was less order, and Doc Crombie, in spite of his sternest
language, was powerless to keep the judicial atmosphere
necessary to treat the matter in a dignified manner.
Smallbones kept up a fiery run of comment and spleenful
argument on every individual who backed the doctor
in his demand for moderation. He ridiculed, he cursed,
he showered personal abuse, until he had everybody by
the ears, and by the sheer power of his venom herded
the majority to side with him.</p>
<p>One of the men he could not influence was Peter
Blunt. He did his utmost to provoke the big man to a
personal attack upon himself that he might turn loose
personalities against him, and charge him with complicity
in some of Jim&rsquo;s doings, however absurdly untrue they
might be. He had all a demagogue&rsquo;s gift for carrying
an audience with him. He never failed to seize upon
an opportunity to launch a poisonous shaft, or sneer at
the class to which Jim and such men as Peter belonged.
Before he left that saloon he meant to obtain a verdict
against his man.</p>
<p>Doc Crombie&rsquo;s anger was hot against the hardware
dealer. He meant ruling against him in the end, but he
was not quite sure how that ruling would be generally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
received. He was now listening to a final appeal from
Peter in the hopes of gleaning something that might help
him when he finally set his foot on the neck of Smallbones&rsquo;
charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, fellers,&rdquo; Peter said, with a quiet directness
of manner, but in a voice that rose above the hum of
general talk, and at once silenced it, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard a
whole heap of &lsquo;tosh&rsquo; from Smallbones and his gang. I
tell you that feller&rsquo;s got a mind as big as a pea, and with
just about as much wind in it. You&rsquo;ve heard him accuse
Jim Thorpe of cattle stealing on evidence which we
all know, and which wouldn&rsquo;t convince a kid of ten, by
reason of its absurd simplicity. Do I need to ask sensible
men such as you if any sane rustler is going to do the
things which you&rsquo;re trying to say Jim Thorpe did? Is
any sane rustler going to use his own brand, and run
stolen cattle with his legitimate stock, in a place where
folks can always see &rsquo;em? Sure, sure you don&rsquo;t need to
ask yourselves even. Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s been a straight man
all his days in Barnriff. &lsquo;Honest Jim Thorpe&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve all
many a time called him. I tell you this thing is a put-up
job. Some dirty, mean skunk has set out to ruin him
for some reason unknown. There are mean folks,&rdquo; he
went on, with his keen eyes fixed on Smallbones, &ldquo;here
in Barnriff. They&rsquo;re mean enough to do this if they
only hated Jim enough. I&rsquo;d hate to cast reflections, but
I believe from the bottom of my heart that Smallbones,
if he hated enough, would do such a trick. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you accusin&rsquo; me, you durned hulk?&rdquo; shrieked
the hardware dealer fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked Peter, calmly. &ldquo;But if you like,
I will. I&rsquo;m not a heap particular. And there&rsquo;d be just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
about as much sense in doing so as there is in your accusations
against Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark at him, fellers,&rdquo; cried the furious Smallbones,
pointing at the big man. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s his friend&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d sell his
stinkin&rsquo; soul for him. He&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell my soul for no man,&rdquo; Peter replied, cutting
him short. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to keep it as decently clean as
such folks as you will let me. Now listen to me. You&rsquo;ve
no right to condemn this man in the way you&rsquo;re trying
to. I don&rsquo;t know what your ultimate intentions are about
him. I dare say some of you would like to hang him,
but there&rsquo;s too many sane men who&rsquo;d stop such as Smallbones
at tricks like that. But you&rsquo;ve no right to banish
him out of the district, or even censure him. He&rsquo;s
done nothing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Henderson woman?&rdquo; cried Smallbones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried several voices, standing near their
little leader.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to mention her name in here, Smallbones,&rdquo;
he cried, with a sudden fierceness, &ldquo;or, small as
you are, I&rsquo;ll smash you to a pulp, and kick you from here
to your store. In your wretched gossip, and in your
scandal-loving hearts you must say and think what you
please, but don&rsquo;t do it here, for I won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur applauded him from Doc Crombie&rsquo;s direction,
and even Smallbones was silenced for the moment. Peter
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, I&rsquo;m known to everybody. I&rsquo;m known in
most places where the grass of the prairie grows, and my
name&rsquo;s mostly good. Well, I want to say right here, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
my oath, Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s no cattle-thief, and, as God is my
judge, I know that to be true. Jim Thorpe hasn&rsquo;t an evil
thought in his&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cried Doc Crombie, excitedly, as the swing
doors were pushed suddenly open. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some one
who&rsquo;ll mebbe have a word to say fer himself. You&rsquo;re
jest in time to say a word or two, Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he smiled,
as the man&rsquo;s pale face appeared in their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; cried Smallbones, his wicked eyes sparkling.
&ldquo;Here he is, fellers. Here is the man I accuse
right here of bein&rsquo; a low-down cattle-thief. That&rsquo;s your
charge, Jim Thorpe. An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t ferget we hang cattle&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your rotten face, you worm!&rdquo; cried Jim, contemptuously.
He was standing in the centre of the room.
Everybody had made way for him, and now he confronted
a circle of accusing faces. He glanced swiftly round till
his dark eyes rested on the hawk-like visage of the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Will Henderson&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet,
solemn voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been murdered. He&rsquo;s lying up
there on the south side of the eastern bluff. Guess
you&rsquo;d best send up and&ndash;&ndash;see to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words produced a sudden and deathly silence.
Every eye was upon his pale face in excited, incredulous
wonderment. Will Henderson dead? Their questioning
eyes asked plainly for more information, while their
tongues were silent with something like awe. Smallbones
reached his glass from the counter and drank its contents
at a gulp, but his eyes never left Jim&rsquo;s face. His astonishment
didn&rsquo;t interfere with the rapid working of his mean
brain. To him Jim looked a sick man. There was something
defiant in the dark eyes. The man, to his swift
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
imagination, was unduly perturbed. He glanced down at
his clothes, and his eyes fixed themselves greedily upon
the fingers of the hand nearest to him. A flash of triumph
shot into his eyes as he heard Doc Crombie&rsquo;s voice suddenly
break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it happen? Who did it?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s answer came promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up there stabbed to death. Stabbed through the
heart. As to who did it, that&rsquo;s to be found out.&rdquo; He
shrugged. His eyes were on the doctor without shrinking.</p>
<p>But he turned swiftly as Smallbones&rsquo; harsh tones drew
every one&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, hold up your left hand, Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he cried
gleefully. &ldquo;Hold it right up an&rsquo; tell us what that red is
on it. Say, I don&rsquo;t guess we&rsquo;ll need to puzzle a heap
over how Will Henderson come by his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim raised his hand. There was nothing else to be
done. For a second he gazed at it ruefully. But it was
only the sight of the murdered man&rsquo;s blood on it that
disturbed him, and not any thought of the consequences
of its discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Will Henderson&rsquo;s blood,&rdquo; he said frankly. &ldquo;It
was necessary for me to touch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frankness of his admission was not without its effect
upon those who did not belong to Smallbones&rsquo; extremist
party, but to them it passed as a mere subterfuge.
They promptly gave voice to an ominous murmur which
momentarily threatened to break out into violence.
But Smallbones saw fresh possibilities. He suddenly
changed his frenzied tactics, and entirely moderated his
tone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come straight in?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s face wore something approaching a
smile. He knew exactly what to expect before the night
was out, and Smallbones&rsquo; questions had no terrors for him.
He had nothing to gain, and nothing to lose, except that
which he had already made up his mind to lose&ndash;&ndash;if necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wer&rsquo; you doin&rsquo; out by that bluff?&rdquo; Smallbones
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man snarled furiously. All eyes were set curiously
upon Jim&rsquo;s face, but there were several smiles at the
manner of the snub. Peter Blunt standing beside Angel
Gay was hopelessly wondering at the sudden turn of
events.</p>
<p>But now Doc Crombie once more took the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send up six boys and bring him in. I&rsquo;ll go
myself.&rdquo; He turned and gave his orders. Then his
luminous eyes settled themselves steadily upon Jim&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;We want the rights o&rsquo; this, sure. Do you know anything
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim was tired of the questioning. He shrugged
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told all I&rsquo;ve got to tell you. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,
go and fetch in the man&rsquo;s body. It&rsquo;ll maybe tell you
more than it told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the bar and called for a drink, which he
devoured thirstily.</p>
<p>But Doc Crombie was not to be dealt with in so cavalier
a fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come along up an&rsquo; show us just wher&rsquo; Henderson
is,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make it easier findin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
He stepped up to him, and tapped him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Do you get me? Ther&rsquo;s been murder done,
an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay right here,&rdquo; said Jim, flashing round on him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen all I want to see up there. You&rsquo;ll have no
difficulty locating him. He&rsquo;s on the south side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Doc began.</p>
<p>But Smallbones, still smarting under his snub, could no
longer keep silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him prisoner,&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Get him now.
Are you goin&rsquo; to let him get away? Once he&rsquo;s on his
horse he&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Say, he&rsquo;s got blood on his hands, and
he&rsquo;s the on&rsquo;y man with reason to wish Will Henderson
dead. Gee, get his guns away an&rsquo; strap him fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the doctor ignored the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming out there, Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he said deliberately,
&ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll hand over your guns, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider myself under your arrest, eh?&rdquo; Jim promptly
removed both of his guns from their holsters, and handed
them, butt first, to the doctor. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll stay right
here,&rdquo; he said easily. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad to hand you those;
it&rsquo;ll save me using them on Smallbones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furious hardware dealer now bristled up, and his
mean face was thrust up so that he stared into Jim&rsquo;s with
all the cruelty of his hatred laid bare in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you ken stay right here an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll look after you,
me an&rsquo; a few o&rsquo; the boys. You&rsquo;re a prisoner, Jim Thorpe,
and if you attempt to escape, we&rsquo;ll blow you to bits.
We&rsquo;ll look after you, sure. You shan&rsquo;t escape, don&rsquo;t you
mistake. It &rsquo;ud do me good to hand you a little lead
pizenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rdquo; was all the answer Jim vouchsafed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></div>
<p>But before Smallbones could retort, Peter Blunt, followed
by Jake Wilkes and Angel Gay, approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here too, Doc,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess Smallbones&rsquo;ll
need help. You see he isn&rsquo;t much of a man to
look after a prisoner. Anyway, Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s a friend
of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Peter, an&rsquo; you two fellers,&rdquo; cried the relieved
doctor. &ldquo;I ken hear the buckboard I sent over for comin&rsquo;
along. I&rsquo;ll start right out.&rdquo; Then he added pointedly,
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll leave him in your charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor passed out and was followed at once by
most of Rocket&rsquo;s customers, all eager to investigate the
murder for their own morbid satisfaction. And thus only
the three friends of Jim Thorpe, with Smallbones and two
others, were left with the prisoner.</p>
<p>The moment the doors had swung to behind the last
of the departures, Peter Blunt suddenly strode across the
room to where Smallbones stood, staring at his intended
victim with snapping eyes. So sudden was his approach
that the little man was taken quite unawares. He seized
him by the collar with one hand, and with the other deprived
him of the guns with which he was still armed,
as a result of his service on the vigilance committee, and,
though he struggled and cursed violently, he carried him
bodily to the door and deliberately flung him outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you attempt to get in here again till Doc returns
I&rsquo;ll throw you out just the same again, if I have to do it
twenty times,&rdquo; Peter declared. Then he turned back to
the men at the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel mean havin&rsquo; to do it,&rdquo; he said, almost shamefacedly.
&ldquo;Only I guess things&rsquo;ll be more comfortable
all round now.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter,&rdquo; said Jim simply, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>Peter took it and wrung it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see he wants to&ndash;&ndash;hang you, Jim,&rdquo; he said by
way of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s words came so solemnly that the men beside him
were startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but you didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;kill him?&rdquo; Peter stammered.</p>
<p>Jim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said decidedly. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll hang me&ndash;&ndash;sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he?&rdquo; cried Peter emphatically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the startled look in his eyes was again replaced by
the shrewd, kindly expression Jim knew so well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>THE TRIUMPH OF SMALLBONES</h3>
</div>
<p>Peter had been talking. Now he paused listening.
Jake and Gay turned their eyes toward the swing doors.
Silas Rocket, who had availed himself of the respite to
wipe a few glasses, paused in his work. He, too, was
listening. But the almost mechanical process of cleaning
glasses was resumed at once. Not even life or death
could long interfere with his scheme of money-making.
He had seen too much of the forceful side of his customers
in his time to let such a thing as a simple murder interfere
with his long established routine.</p>
<p>It was Jim who now spoke. He was the calmest of
those present, except perhaps Silas Rocket. He appeared
to have no fear of the consequences of this affair to himself.
Perhaps it was the confidence of innocence. Perhaps
it was the great courage of a brave man for whom
death&ndash;&ndash;even a disgraceful death&ndash;&ndash;has no terrors. Perhaps
it was the knowledge of what he was saving the
woman he loved, which served to inspire him. His eyes
were even smiling as he looked into Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming along,&rdquo; he said, with one ear turned
toward the door.</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them, sure,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ken hear the buckboard. It&rsquo;s movin&rsquo; slow,&rdquo; said
Gay solemnly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Which means they got him,&rdquo; added Jake conclusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a drink first,&rdquo; said Jim. Then he added
whimsically, &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silent acceptance of his invitation was due to the
significance of their host&rsquo;s position. And afterward the
glasses were set down empty upon the counter, without a
word. Then Jim turned to Peter, and his manner was a
trifle regretful. But that was all. An invincible purpose
shone in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here in a minute, Peter,&rdquo; he said, with a
shadowy smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a word to say before they get
around. We&rsquo;ve been good friends, and now, at the last,
I&rsquo;d hate you to get a wrong notion of things. I call God
to witness that I did not kill Will Henderson. It&rsquo;s because
we&rsquo;re friends I tell you this, now. It&rsquo;s because
these folk are going to hang me. You can stake your
last cent on that being the truth, and if you don&rsquo;t get
paid in this world, I sure guess you will in the next.
Well&ndash;&ndash;here they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished speaking the doors were pushed open
and men began to stream in. It was a curiously silent
crowd. For these men a death, even a murder, had little
awe. They understood too well the forceful methods of
the back countries, where the laws of civilization had
difficulty in reaching. They had too long governed their
own social affairs without appeal to the parent government.
What could Washington know of their requirements?
What could a judge of the circuit know of the
conditions in which they lived? They preferred their
own methods, drastic as they were and often wrong in
their judgments. Yet, on the whole, they were efficacious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
and salutary. Life and death were small enough
matters to them, but the career of a criminal, and its
swift termination, short, sharp and violent, was of paramount
importance. It was the thought that they believed
there was justice, their own justice, to be dealt out
to a criminal that night, that now depressed them to an
awed silence.</p>
<p>Three or four men placed several of the small tables
together, forming them into a sort of bier. Then they
stood by while others pushed their way in through the
swing doors. Finally, two men stood just inside, holding
the doors open, while two of the ranchmen carried in
their ominous, silent burden. Doc Crombie was the last
but one to enter. The man who came last was the evil-minded
hardware dealer. His eyes were sparkling, and
his thin lips were tightly compressed. Now he had an
added score to pay off. Nor was he particular to whom
he paid it.</p>
<p>The body of the murdered man was laid upon the
tables, and Silas Rocket provided a shroud.</p>
<p>Jim Thorpe watched these proceedings with the
keenest interest. Never for a moment did he remove
his eyes from the dead man, until the dirty white tablecloth
had been carelessly thrown over him. He had in
his mind many things during those moments. At first
he had looked for his own telltale knife. But evidently
it had been removed. There was no sign of its hideous
projecting handle as he had last seen it. Neither had he
noticed any one bearing his blood-stained handkerchiefs.
He thought that Doc Crombie had possessed himself of
these things, and expected he would produce them at the
proper moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>Somehow he felt a curious regret that Will was dead.
It was not a mawkish sentimentality; he made no pretension,
even to himself, that the regard that had once been
his for Will still existed. But he was sorry. Sorry that
the man&rsquo;s road had carried him to such disaster. He remembered
Peter&rsquo;s definition of the one-way trail. Will&rsquo;s
path had certainly been a hard one, and he had traveled
every inch of it with&ndash;&ndash;well, he had traveled it.</p>
<p>Then came the thought, the ironical thought, that after
all their paths were not so very wide apart now. They
had grown up together, and now, at the end, in spite of
everything, death was bringing them very near together
again.</p>
<p>But his reflections were cut short by the sharp voice
of the doctor. His authority was once more undisputed.
He stood out in the centre of the room, a lean, harsh
figure. His eagle face, with its luminous eyes, was full
of power, full of a stern purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;murder has been done&ndash;&ndash;sheer,
bloody murder. When fellers gits busy with guns, an&rsquo;
each has his chance, an&rsquo; one of &rsquo;em gits it bad, we call
that killing. Fair, square killing, an&rsquo; I guess we treat it
accordin&rsquo;. But this is low-down murder. We was told
it was a stabbing, but I&rsquo;ve cast my eyes over the body,
an&rsquo; I seem to see a different story. Judging by what I
found, I&rsquo;d say Will Henderson was hit a smashin&rsquo; blow
by something heavy, which must sure &rsquo;a&rsquo; knocked him
senseless, an&rsquo; then the lousy skunk did the rest of his
work with a knife. Gents, I allow this murder was the
work of a dirty, cowardly, mean-spirited skunk who
hadn&rsquo;t the grit to face his enemy decently with a gun,
and who doesn&rsquo;t need a heap of mercy when we get him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
That&rsquo;s how I read the case. All of you have seen the
body, so I need say no more on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned his keen eyes on Jim Thorpe, who had
listened closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Jim Thorpe, brought us word of this doing.
An&rsquo; in the interests of justice to his widow, to your feller
citizens, your duty&rsquo;s clear. You got to tell us right
here everything you know about Will Henderson&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an ominous pause when the doctor finished
speaking, while all eyes were focused upon Jim&rsquo;s face.
There was no doubt but that the majority were looking
for signs of that guilt which in their hearts they believed
to be his.</p>
<p>But they were doomed to disappointment. They certainly
saw a change of expression, for Jim was puzzled.
Why had Doc Crombie not produced the knife and the
handkerchiefs? But perhaps he wanted his story first,
and then would confront him with the evidence against
him. Yet his manner was purely judicial. It in no way
suggested that he possessed damning evidence.</p>
<p>He looked fearlessly around, and his gaze finally settled
upon the doctor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m puzzled, Doc,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly
something I can&rsquo;t make out. I told you all I had
to tell,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I was out on the south side of
that bluff, for reasons which I told Anthony Smallbones
were my own business, when I found Will Henderson
lying dead in the grass, a few feet from some bushes. I
did not at first realize he was dead. I saw the wound on
his jaw, and, touching it, discovered the bone was broken.
Then I discovered that his clothes were torn open, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
chest bare, and a large knife, such as any prairie man
carries in his belt, was sticking in his chest, plunged right
up to the hilt.&rdquo; There was a stir, and a murmur of astonishment
went round the room. &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; he
continued, holding up his hand for silence. &ldquo;I discovered
more than that. I found two handkerchiefs, a white
one, ripped into a rough bandage, and a silk neck scarf,
such as many of us wear, was folded up into a sort of
pad. Both were blood-stained, and looked as though
they had been used as bandages for his face. They were
lying a yard away from the body. Have you got those
things, because, if so, they ought to be a handsome clue
for sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by the expression of blank astonishment, even incredulity
on the doctor&rsquo;s face, and a similar response from
most of the onlookers, it was obvious that this was all
news to them.</p>
<p>Doc shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo; was no knife&ndash;&ndash;no scarves. But say,&rdquo; he asked
sharply, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you speak of &rsquo;em before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t occur to me. I thought you&rsquo;d sure find &rsquo;em.
So&ndash;&ndash;I guess they&rsquo;ve been removed since. Probably the
murderer thought them incriminating&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hell of a fine yarn.&rdquo; It was Smallbones&rsquo; voice
that now made itself heard. &ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;se fellows
see his drift? It&rsquo;s a yarn to put you off, an&rsquo; make
you think the murderer&rsquo;s been around while he&rsquo;s been in
here. Guess him an&rsquo; his friend Peter&rsquo;s made it up while
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I threw you out of here,&rdquo; interjected Peter
coldly. &ldquo;Keep your tongue easy, or I&rsquo;ll have to handle
you again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></div>
<p>But Smallbones&rsquo; fury got the better of him, and he
meant to annoy Peter all he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dessay you would. But you can&rsquo;t blind us
like a lot of gophers with a dogone child&rsquo;s yarn like that.
If those things had been there they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been there when
Will was found by Doc&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Say,&rdquo; he cried, turning
with inspiration upon Jim, &ldquo;wher&rsquo;s your knife? You
mostly carry one. I see your sheath, but ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no
knife in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed at the back of Jim&rsquo;s waist, which was
turned toward him. Every eye that could see the sheath
followed the direction of the accusing finger, and a profound
sensation stirred those who beheld. The sheath
was empty.</p>
<p>Smallbones&rsquo; triumph urged him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, an&rsquo; where&rsquo;s your neck-scarf? You allus wear
one, sure. An&rsquo; mebbe you ain&rsquo;t got your dandy white
han&rsquo;k&rsquo;chief. I &rsquo;lows you&rsquo;re &rsquo;bout the on&rsquo;y man in these
parts &rsquo;cep&rsquo; Abe Horsley as fancies hisself enough to wear
one. Wher&rsquo;s them things, I ask you? Say,&rdquo; he went
on after a moment&rsquo;s pause, during which Jim still remained
silent, &ldquo;I accuse this lousy skunk publicly of
murderin&rsquo; Will Henderson. He&rsquo;s convicted hisself out
o&rsquo; his own mouth, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got the man&rsquo;s blood on his
hands. Jim Thorpe, you killed Will Henderson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man&rsquo;s fervor, his boldness, his shrewd argument
carried his audience with him, as he stood pointing
dramatically at the accused but unflinching man. Doc
Crombie was carried along with the rest even against his
own judgment. Peter Blunt and Angel Gay, with Jake
Wilkes, were the only men present who were left unconvinced.
Peter&rsquo;s eyes were sternly fixed on the beady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
eyes of Smallbones. Gay, too, in his slow way, was
furious. But Jake would not have believed Jim had
committed the murder even if he had seen him do it, he
detested Smallbones so much.</p>
<p>But everybody was waiting for Jim&rsquo;s reply to the challenge.
And it came amidst a deathly silence. It came
with a straightforwardness that carried conviction to three
of his hearers at least, and set the redoubtable doctor
wondering if he were dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right I usually wear all those things you
say, but I haven&rsquo;t got them with me now, because&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
smiled into the little man&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;the particular
articles I spoke of were all mine, and, apparently, now
they&rsquo;ve been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty, by Gad!&rdquo; roared Smallbones.</p>
<p>And some one near him added&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynch him! Lynch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How that cry might have been taken up and acted
upon, it needs little imagination to guess. But quick
as thought Doc Crombie came to Jim&rsquo;s rescue. He
silenced the crowd with a roar like some infuriated lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first man that moves I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo; he cried, behind
the brace of leveled pistols he was now holding at
arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>He stood for a few seconds thus till order was restored,
then he quietly returned one of his guns to its holster,
while the other he retained in his hand. He turned at
once to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re accused of the murder of Will Henderson by
Smallbones,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got more of this
story back of your head. You&rsquo;ve now got your chance
of ladlin&rsquo; it out to clear yourself. You&rsquo;d best speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
An&rsquo; the quicker the better. You say the knife that
killed him was yours. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s honest intention was obvious. He wanted
to give Jim a chance. He was doing his utmost. But
he knew the temper of these men, and he knew that they
were not to be played with. It was up to the accused
man to clear himself.</p>
<p>Peter Blunt anxiously watched Jim&rsquo;s face. There was
something like despair in his honest eyes. But he could
do nothing without the other&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>Jim looked straight into the doctor&rsquo;s eyes. There was
no defiance in his look, neither was there anything of the
guilty man in it. It was simply honest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all I have to tell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The knife
that killed Will Henderson was my knife. But I swear
before God that I am innocent of his death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor turned from him with an oath. And
curiously enough his oath was purely at the man&rsquo;s
obstinacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellers,&rdquo; he said, addressing the assembly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been your leader for a goodish bit, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t guess I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; back on you now. We got a code of laws right
here in Barnriff with which we handle sech cases as this.
Those laws&rsquo;ll take their course. We&rsquo;ll try the case right
here an&rsquo; now. You, Smallbones, will establish your
case.&rdquo; Then he turned to Jim. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any feller
you&rsquo;d like&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; cried Peter Blunt, in a
voice that echoed throughout the building.</p>
<p>Doc Crombie nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, the court is open.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>AFTER THE VERDICT</h3>
</div>
<p>Peter Blunt stared helplessly up at the eastern sky.
His brain was whirling, and he stared without being conscious
of the reason.</p>
<p>He breathed heavily, like a man saturating his lungs
with pure air after long confinement in a foul atmosphere.
Then it almost seemed as if his great frame shrank in
stature, and became suddenly a wreck of itself. As if
age and decay had suddenly come upon him. As if the
weight of his body had become too heavy for him, and
set his great limbs tottering under it as he walked.</p>
<p>The excitement, the straining of thought and nerve
had passed, leaving him hopelessly oppressed, twenty
years older.</p>
<p>The din and clamor of the final scenes in the saloon
were still ringing in his ears. It was all over. The farce
of Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s trial had been played out. But the
shouts of men, hungering for the life of a fellow man, still
haunted him. The voice of the accuser was still shrieking
through his brain. The memory of the stern condemnation
of Doc Crombie left his great heart crushed
and helpless.</p>
<p>His brain was still whirling with all the strain he had
gone through, his pulses were still hammering with the
consuming anger which had raged in him as he stood beside
his friend defending him to the last. And it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
all proved useless. Jim Thorpe had been condemned
by the ballot of his fellow citizens. Death&ndash;&ndash;a hideous,
disgraceful death was to be his, at the moment when the
gray dawn should first lift the eastern corner of the pall
of night.</p>
<p>The saloon was behind Peter now. Its lights were still
burning. For the condemned man was to remain there
with his guards until the appointed time.</p>
<p>Peter remembered Jim&rsquo;s look when he finally bade him
leave him. Could he ever forget it? He had seen death
in many forms in his time. He had seen many men face
it, each in his own way. But never in his life had he
seen such calmness, such apparent indifference as Jim
Thorpe had displayed.</p>
<p>When the ballot was taken and the doctor pronounced
sentence, there was never a tremor of an eyelid. There
was not even one quick-drawn breath. Nor was there a
suggestion of any emotion&ndash;&ndash;save that of indifference.</p>
<p>Then when the doctor had named the manner of his
death&ndash;&ndash;a rawhide rope on the bough of a tree&ndash;&ndash;Jim had
turned with a smile to Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to be shot,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;But there,
I s&rsquo;pose this thing must proceed by custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jim received the pronouncement of the final penalty
for a crime of which Peter was convinced he was innocent.</p>
<p>It had suddenly set his loyal heart longing with a mad,
passionate longing to have his great hands about the
mean throat of the man Smallbones. It had set him
wild with rebellion against the merciless customs which
permitted such an outrage upon justice. He had even
challenged the doctor in his fury, on his right to administer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
justice and accept the condemnation of the men
gathered there for the purpose.</p>
<p>In his desire to serve his friend he passed beyond the
bounds of all discretion, of all safety for himself. He
threatened that he would move the whole world to bring
just retribution upon those who had participated in that
night&rsquo;s work. And his threats and violence had been received
with a tolerant laughter. A derision more stinging
and ominous than the most furious outbreak.</p>
<p>The work would go on. The death penalty would be
carried out. He knew it. He knew it.</p>
<p>Then when it was all over, and the prisoner&rsquo;s guards
had been appointed, Jim had begged him to leave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter, old friend,&rdquo; he said. And then added
with a whimsical touch: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired to death of hearing
your dear old voice. You&rsquo;ve said such a heap to-night.
Get along. I don&rsquo;t want you any more. You see you&rsquo;re
too big, and you sure take up too much room&ndash;&ndash;in my
heart. So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he had been driven from his friend&rsquo;s side, and out
into the blackest night he had ever known.</p>
<p>Yes, it was an old, old man that now lurched his way
across the market-place toward his hut. He was weary,
so weary in mind and spirit. There was nothing now left
for him to do but to go home and&ndash;&ndash;and sit there till the
dawn. Was there no hope, none? There was none.
No earthly force could save Jim now. It wanted less
than an hour to dawn, and, between now and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And yet he believed Jim could have saved himself.
There was not a man in that room, from Doc Crombie
downward, but knew that Jim was holding back something.
What was it? And why did he not speak?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
Peter had asked him while the farce of a trial was at its
height. He had begged and implored him to speak out,
but the answer he received was the same as had been
given to the doctor. Jim had told all he had to tell. Oh,
the whole thing was madness&ndash;&ndash;madness.</p>
<p>But there was no madness in Jim, he admitted. Once
when his importunities tried him Jim had shown him just
one brief glimpse of the heart which no death penalty
had the power to reveal.</p>
<p>Peter remembered his words now; they would live in
his memory to his dying day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure make me angry, Peter,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;Even
to you, old friend, I have nothing more to say of this killing
than I have said to Doc, and the rest of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve
done many a fool trick in my time, and maybe I&rsquo;m doing
another now. But I&rsquo;m doing it with my eyes wide open.
There&rsquo;s the rope ahead, a nasty, ugly, curly rope; maybe
plaited by a half-breed with dirty hands. But what&rsquo;s the
odds? Perhaps there&rsquo;s a stray bit of comfort in that rope,
in the thought of it. You know the old prairie saw: &lsquo;It
isn&rsquo;t always the sunniest day makes the best picnic.&rsquo;
Which means, I take it, choose your company of girls and
boys well, and, rain or shine, you&rsquo;ll have a bully time.
Maybe there&rsquo;s a deal I could say if I so chose, but, in the
meantime, I kind of believe there&rsquo;s worse things in the
world than&ndash;&ndash;a rawhide rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just a glimpse of the man behind his mask of indifference,
and Peter wondered.</p>
<p>But there was no key to the riddle in his words, no key
at all. Somehow, in a vague sort of way, it seemed to
him that Eve Henderson was in a measure the influence
behind Jim. But he could not see how. He was well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
aware of Jim&rsquo;s love for her, and he believed that she was
less indifferent to him now than when Will had been running
straight. But for the life of him he could see no
definite connection between such a matter and the murder.
It was all so obscure&ndash;&ndash;so obscure.</p>
<p>And now there was nothing left but to wait for the
hideous end. He lurched into his hut, and, without even
troubling to light his lamp, flung himself upon his bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE TRUTH</h3>
</div>
<p>The moment Peter Blunt left the saloon, a lurking
figure stole out from the shadow of one of the side walls,
where it had been standing close under a window, listening
to all that passed within the building. It followed
on a few yards behind the preoccupied man with a stealthy
but clumsy gait. Peter heard nothing and saw nothing.
His mind and heart were too full to care in the least for
anything that was going on about him now.</p>
<p>So it was that Elia, for it was he, laboriously followed
him up until he saw the man&rsquo;s burly figure disappear into
his hut. Then he turned away with something of relief,
and hobbled in the direction of his own house. He had
been anxious lest Peter should be on his way to carry the
news to Eve. He had very definite reasons for wishing
to give her the news himself. He felt that Peter was too
convinced of Jim&rsquo;s innocence, judging by his defense of
him in the saloon, to be a safe person to carry Eve the
news. He was thinking of his own safety, and his distorted
mind was at work gauging Peter from his own
standpoint. He felt he must avoid Peter for the present.
Peter was too shrewd. Peter might&ndash;&ndash;yes, he must certainly
avoid him until after&ndash;&ndash;dawn. Then it would not
matter.</p>
<p>Sick in body as well as in mind after the evening&rsquo;s
events, the low, cruel cunning which possessed him was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
still hard at work scheming to fulfil both his vicious desires
and to hedge himself round in safety.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had been near home since
he had returned from the bluff. He had painfully followed
Jim into the village and shadowed him down to
the saloon. He was in an extremity of terror the whole
time, from the moment he realized Jim&rsquo;s intention to
notify the villagers of what had happened until the end
of the trial, when he heard the sentence passed. Then,
curiously enough, his terror only abated the slightest
degree.</p>
<p>But he was very sick, nearly dropping with fatigue and
bodily suffering. Something was wrong in his chest, and
the pain of it was excruciating. There were moments
when the shooting pains in his poor curved spine set
him almost shrieking. Will&rsquo;s blows had done their work
on his weakly frame, and it felt to him to be all broken
up.</p>
<p>When he reached his sister&rsquo;s gate, he stood for some
moments leaning on it gasping for breath. His strength
was well-nigh expended, leaving him faint and dizzy.
Slowly his breathing eased, and he glanced at the
windows. The lamps were still burning inside. Evidently
Eve was waiting for something. Had she heard? He
wondered. Was she now waiting for the verdict? Perhaps
she was only waiting for his own return.</p>
<p>And while he considered a flash of the devil, that was
always busy within him, stirred once more. He had
come to tell her of it all. And the thought pleased him.
For the moment he forgot something of his bodily
sufferings in the joy of the thought of the pain he was
about to inflict upon her. He groped his hand in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
jacket pocket. Yes, they were all there, the knife and
the handkerchief that had so puzzled the doctor and
those others.</p>
<p>He stealthily opened the gate and walked up the path.
At the door he stood listening. Some one was stirring
within. Hark! That sounded like Eve sobbing. Now
she was speaking. Was she speaking to herself&ndash;&ndash;or to
some one else? He listened acutely. He could only
hear the murmur of her voice. There was no other
sound within.</p>
<p>Suddenly he drew back from the door. He heard her
footsteps approaching. Wondering what she was going
to do he withdrew out of sight. The door opened, and
Eve stood leaning against the casing. He could only
see her outline against the lamplight behind her, for her
face was lost in the shadow. It seemed to him that she
was staring out at the saloon. Maybe she was waiting
till the lights were put out, and so she would know the
trial was over. Maybe, even, she was contemplating going
down there in search of the news she was so fearfully
awaiting. These suggestions occurred to Elia, for
he had a tremendously shrewd knowledge of his sister,
as he had of most people with whom he came into contact.</p>
<p>It occurred to him now that it was time he showed himself.
The grinding pains in his body would no longer be
denied. He must get inside and rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis,&rdquo; he called in a low voice. &ldquo;Ho, sis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman started as the boy hobbled out into the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elia!&rdquo; she cried. And the next moment she would
have clasped him in her arms, and hugged him to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
bosom. But he drew back. He feared her embraces.
Nor was he in the mood to submit to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fule, sis. I&rsquo;m tired&ndash;&ndash;dog tired. I&rsquo;m sick,
too. I believe somethin&rsquo;s broken inside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed her on one side and hurried into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in an&rsquo; shut that gol-durned door,&rdquo; he cried,
without turning, as he made his way to the rocking-chair.
He dropped into it, his face contorting hideously with the
awful pain the process caused him.</p>
<p>But the spasm passed after a few moments, and when
he looked up Eve was standing before him. He eyed
her silently for some time. He was wondering just how
much she knew.</p>
<p>There was little doubt in his mind that she knew a
great deal. Horror and suffering were so deeply lined
upon her young face, and in her beautiful eyes was such
a wild, hunted look, that there was very little doubt in
his mind that she knew what most of the village knew
by this time. But she didn&rsquo;t know all he knew, not by a
lot. And she wasn&rsquo;t going to know it all. Only some
of it. She was suffering. So was he&ndash;&ndash;in a different way.
He would help her to suffer more yet. It was good to
see other folks suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s bin here, sis?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Annie. But, Elia, tell me you&ndash;&ndash;you didn&rsquo;t
meet Will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy chuckled without any visible sign. Even
the pain of his body could not rob him of his cruel love
of inflicting pain. He ignored her question for the
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie?&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Did she tell you, sis?
Did she tell you your Will was dead? Eh?&rdquo; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
leaned forward, his eyes sparkling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad&ndash;&ndash;real
glad. He was sure bad, an&rsquo; no use to you. She told
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly the poor woman buried her face in her
hands, as though to shut out the hideous thoughts his
words brought back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s dead, and they&rsquo;re
trying Jim for it. Oh, God, it&rsquo;s awful! They say he did
it. But he didn&rsquo;t, I know he didn&rsquo;t. He only said he&rsquo;d
do it if Will had killed you. He didn&rsquo;t kill you, so Jim
didn&rsquo;t do it. He wouldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t. And I sent
him out there to the bluff. And if they hang him it&rsquo;s
my doing. Oh, Jim, Jim!&rdquo; She fell to moaning and
rocking herself as she stood. &ldquo;But they mustn&rsquo;t kill
him. They won&rsquo;t. Will they? Say they won&rsquo;t, Elia.
Oh, Jim, Jim! I want you so badly. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweet on him, sis?&rdquo; Elia said, with a gleam
of fiendish satisfaction in his wonderful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him,&rdquo; reiterated the woman, ignoring his question,
and lost in her own misery. &ldquo;Oh, Jim, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time at least the boy had quite forgotten his
bodily sufferings. His enjoyment was monstrous, unholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, sis,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the trial&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;ve just
come from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve looked up, startled. Every nerve in her body
was quivering with a sudden tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s sure over,&rdquo; the boy added, prolonging his
sister&rsquo;s agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? They&ndash;&ndash;they acquitted him?&rdquo; There was
something absolutely imploring in her manner. It might
well have moved a heart of stone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></div>
<p>But Elia&rsquo;s heart, if he possessed such an organ, bore the
brand of the fiend. He nodded first. Then, as he saw
the joy leap to his sister&rsquo;s eyes he shook his head vigorously,
and the result pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to die,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman suddenly reeled, and fell on her knees at
the table, with her face buried on her outstretched arms.
Elia watched her for some moments. He felt that here
was some recompense for what he had gone through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was kind o&rsquo; sweet on him, sis,&rdquo; he said presently.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I tried to help him some. I kind o&rsquo; like
him, too. I feel sort o&rsquo; queer Jim&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to get hanged&ndash;&ndash;hanged,
sis, at dawn.&rdquo; He paused, but beyond the racking
sobs that shook the woman&rsquo;s frame she made no
movement. &ldquo;I sure feel queer about it, tho&rsquo;. Y&rsquo;see
he came right up when Will had nigh kicked the life
out o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; he hit Will a smash that knocked him
cold. Gee, it was a smash! Jim hurt Will bad, an&rsquo; it
was for me. Say, that&rsquo;s why I feel queer they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
to&ndash;&ndash;hang him at dawn. Somehow, it don&rsquo;t seem good
stretchin&rsquo; Jim&rsquo;s neck. I don&rsquo;t seem to feel I&rsquo;d like to see
Jim hurted. Must be because he hurted Will fer me.
Will &rsquo;ud &rsquo;a&rsquo; killed me, sure, but fer Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words had become a sort of soliloquy. He had
forgotten his sister for the moment. But now, as she
looked up, he remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried to&ndash;&ndash;to save him?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You
told them what Will was doing? You told them how&ndash;&ndash;how
it all happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head, and again his eyes lit with
malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been inside the saloon. I&ndash;&ndash;I was scared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
Y&rsquo;see Will wasn&rsquo;t killed by the blow Jim give him. Guess
that on&rsquo;y jest knocked him out. Y&rsquo;see he was killed with
Jim&rsquo;s knife&ndash;&ndash;after. Y&rsquo;see Jim&rsquo;s a fule. After he&rsquo;d hit
him he fixed his face up with his han&rsquo;k&rsquo;chiefs, an&rsquo; after he
was good an&rsquo; dead he went fer to leave his knife stickin&rsquo;
in his chest. That&rsquo;s wher&rsquo; I helped him some. I took
that knife out&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; them rags. Here they are, right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly produced the blood-stained knife and the
handkerchiefs, and held them out toward her. But the
woman shrank away from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed if I took &rsquo;em right away no one &rsquo;ud know
how he come by his death, an&rsquo; who did it. Y&rsquo;see Jim had
helped me some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eve was not heeding the explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he did&ndash;&ndash;kill him?&rdquo; Her question was a low,
horrified whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&ndash;&ndash;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he had&ndash;&ndash;struck him senseless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. You are lying to me, Elia.&rdquo; The
woman&rsquo;s voice was strident, even harsh.</p>
<p>Elia understood. It was her desire to convince herself
of Jim&rsquo;s innocence that set her accusing him. It was
not that she really disbelieved. Had it been otherwise
he would have been afraid. As it was he gloated over
her suffering instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a fule, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sure got to hang,&rdquo; he said
mildly. &ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;ll be dawn come half an hour. Then
they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take him right out ther&rsquo; wher&rsquo; he killed
your Will&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; hang him. Smallbones is goin&rsquo; out to find
the tree. Say, sis, Smallbones is goin&rsquo; to get busy pullin&rsquo;
the rope. I wish it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t Jim, sure I do. I&rsquo;d sooner it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
was Peter, on&rsquo;y he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give me that gold. Guess it
wouldn&rsquo;t matter if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shan&rsquo;t hang him! I don&rsquo;t believe it. I can&rsquo;t
believe it. I don&rsquo;t believe you. Oh, God, this is awful!
Elia, say it isn&rsquo;t so; say you are only&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fule, sis,&rdquo; the boy cried, brutally. &ldquo;Guess
if you can&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve me go an&rsquo; ast Peter. He&rsquo;s in his hut.
He helped defend Jim, an&rsquo; said a heap o&rsquo; fule things
&rsquo;bout gettin&rsquo; the law on Doc. Ast him if you don&rsquo;t
b&rsquo;lieve me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whereas he had only intended to force her belief
by his challenge, Eve took him literally. She snatched
at his words, and he suddenly became afraid. She picked
up the knife and the rags, which before she had refused
to touch, and grasped him by one wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we&rsquo;ll go over to Peter, and I&rsquo;ll have the truth
from him. I can&rsquo;t trust you, Elia. You were there when
Will was murdered; you&rsquo;ve been down to the saloon, outside
it. You must have seen the killing, and you&rsquo;ve not
said one word in his defense, not one word as to the reason
of Will&rsquo;s death. Jim did it in your defense, and you&rsquo;re
letting him hang without a word to help him. You shall
tell Peter what you&rsquo;ve told me, and maybe it isn&rsquo;t too late
to do something yet. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy tried to drag free. His guilty conscience
made him fear Peter, and in a frenzy he struggled to release
himself.</p>
<p>But Eve was no longer the gentle, indulgent woman
he had always known. She was fighting for a life perhaps
dearer to her than Elia&rsquo;s. She saw a barely possible
chance that through Elia she might yet save Jim.
Will&rsquo;s brutal attack upon a cripple had met with perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
something more than its deserts, but these men were
men, and maybe the extenuation of the provocation
might at least save Jim the rope.</p>
<p>Elia quickly gave up the struggle. His bodily hurts
had robbed him of what little physical strength he possessed
at the best of times; and Eve, for all her slightness,
was by no means a weak woman. She literally
forced him to go, half dragging him, and never for a moment
relaxing her hold upon him.</p>
<p>And so they came to Peter&rsquo;s hut. She knocked loudly
at the door, and called to him, fearing, because she
saw no light, that the man had gone out again. But
Peter was there, and his astonished voice answered her
summons at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve?&rdquo; he cried, in something like consternation, for
he was thinking of the news he must now give her.
Then he appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, light a lamp,&rdquo; the woman cried. &ldquo;Elia has
told me all about it. He says Jim is to die at&ndash;&ndash;dawn.&rdquo;
She glanced involuntarily at the eastern horizon, and to
her horror beheld the first pale reflection of morning
light, hovering, an almost milky lightening, where all else
was still jet black.</p>
<p>Peter had no words with which to answer her. He
had dreaded seeing her, and now&ndash;&ndash;she knew. He lit the
lamp, and Eve dragged the unwilling boy in with her;
and as she passed him over to Peter&rsquo;s bed he fell back on
it groaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she cried now, speaking with a rush, since
dawn was so near. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something be done? Surely,
surely, there is extenuation! He did it all to defend
Elia. Will was killing him out there at the bluff. Look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
at him! Can&rsquo;t you see his suffering? That&rsquo;s why Jim
killed him. Elia&rsquo;s just told me so. He even took these
things from&ndash;&ndash;from the body after&ndash;&ndash;thinking it might
save Jim. He brought them to me just now; and he
says he&rsquo;s been down at the saloon, and never said a word
to help Jim. He said he was frightened to go in. Did
Jim tell them it was to save Elia? Oh, surely they can
be made to understand it was not wilful&ndash;&ndash;wilful murder!
They can&rsquo;t hang him. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the astonished Peter listened to her words, words
which told him a side of the story he had never even
dreamed of before, his eyes drifted and fixed themselves
on the now ghastly face of the boy. He compelled the
terror-stricken eyes and held them with his own. And
when Eve ceased speaking he answered her without turning.
He was reading, reading through the insane mind
of the boy, right down into his very soul. In the long days
he had had Elia working with him he had studied him
closely. And he had learned the twists and warps of his
nature as no one else understood them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim said nothing at all!&rdquo; Peter said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing? What do you mean? He&ndash;&ndash;he must have
told them of&ndash;&ndash;of Elia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Peter&rsquo;s eyes shot in the direction of the
door. A faint, distant sound reached them. It was a
sound of bustle from the direction of the saloon. Eve
heard too. They both understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>But Peter&rsquo;s eyes were on Elia&rsquo;s face once more. They
were stern, and a curious light was in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to see it now,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Jim denied
his guilt because he was innocent. But he admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
that the knife which killed Will was his, although no
knife was found. He spoke the truth the whole time.
He would not stoop to a lie, because he was innocent.
Eve, that man was shielding the real culprit. Do you
know any one that Jim would be likely to give his life
for? I do.&rdquo; Suddenly he swung round on Elia, and,
with an arm outstretched, and a great finger pointing,
he cried, &ldquo;Why did you kill Will Henderson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspiration had come. A great light of hope shone
in his eyes. His demand was irresistible to the suffering,
demented boy. Elia&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with a sudden
cruel frenzy. There was the light of madness in them, a
vicious, furious madness in them. Hatred of Will surged
through his fevered brain, a furious triumph at the
thought of having paid Will for all his cruelties to him
swept away any guilty fears as he blurted out his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I hate him. Because he&rsquo;s kicked me till I&rsquo;m
nigh dead. Because&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tremendous moment, and fraught with such possibilities
as a few minutes ago would have seemed impossible.
There was a silence of horror in the room. The
shock had left Eve staggered. Peter was calculating
what seemed almost impossible chances. Elia&ndash;&ndash;Elia was
in the agonies of realizing what he had done, and battling
with an overwhelming physical weakness.</p>
<p>The sounds of commotion at the saloon were more
decided. There was the ominous galloping of horses,
and the rattle of the wheels of a buckboard. Peter
glanced at the window. The sky outside was lightening.
Suddenly he shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed him. How? How?&rdquo; His voice was
tense and harsh, though he strove to soften it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></div>
<p>But Elia had turned sullen. A fierce resentment held
him silent, resentment and fear.</p>
<p>And in that moment of waiting for his answer Peter
heard again the movements of the cavalcade at the saloon.
It seemed to be under way for&ndash;&ndash;the bluff.</p>
<p>Now he leaned toward the boy, and his great honest
brow was sweating with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I go and tell them they&rsquo;ll hang
you, too. Do you understand? I&rsquo;m not going to bluff
you. This is just fact. They&rsquo;ll hang you if I tell them.
And I&rsquo;m going to tell them, sure, if you don&rsquo;t do as I say.
If you do as I say they won&rsquo;t touch you. You&rsquo;ve got to
come along with me and tell them you killed Will, and
just why. They&rsquo;re men, those fellers, and they&rsquo;ll be real
sorry for you. You&rsquo;ve got to tell the whole truth just as
it happened, and I give you my word they won&rsquo;t touch
you. You&rsquo;ll save Jim&rsquo;s life. Jim who was always good
to you. Jim who went out to the bluff to save you from
Will. You needn&rsquo;t to be scared,&rdquo; as signs of fresh terror
broke out upon the boy&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t to be scared
any. I&rsquo;ll be there with you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; cried Eve, her eyes suddenly lighting
with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come, boy? You&rsquo;ll save Jim, who never did
you anything but good. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, laddie,&rdquo; Peter went on, his eyes straining with
fear, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re moving now. Can you hear them? That&rsquo;s
the men who&rsquo;re taking Jim out to kill him&ndash;&ndash;and when
they&rsquo;ve killed him they&rsquo;ll kill you, because I shall tell
them &rsquo;bout you. Will you help us save Jim&ndash;&ndash;Jim
who was always good to you, or will you let them kill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
him&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; then you? Hark, they&rsquo;re crossing toward us
now. Soon, and they&rsquo;ll be gone, and then it&rsquo;ll be too
late. They&rsquo;ll then have to come back for you, and&ndash;&ndash;you
won&rsquo;t be able to get that gold I promised you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve sat breathlessly watching. Peter&rsquo;s steady persistence
was something to marvel at. She wanted to shriek
out and seize the suffering cripple, and shake what little
life there yet remained out of him. The suspense was
dreadful. She looked for a sign of the lightening of that
cloud of horror and suffering on the boy&rsquo;s face. She
looked for that sign of yielding they both hoped and
prayed for.</p>
<p>But Peter went on, and it seemed to the woman he
must win out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, speak up, laddie,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Play the
man. They shan&rsquo;t hurt you, I swear it. Ther&rsquo;s all that
gold waiting. You&rsquo;ve seen it on the reef in the cutting,
right here in Barnriff. It&rsquo;s yours when you&rsquo;ve done this
thing, but you won&rsquo;t be here to get it if you don&rsquo;t. Will
you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;won&rsquo;t hang me?&rdquo; the boy whispered, in
dreadful fear.</p>
<p>The death party were quite near now. Peter heard
them. He felt that they were nearly across the market-place.
He glanced out of the window. Yes, there they
were. Jim was sitting in the buckboard beside Doc
Crombie. The rest of the crowd were in the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear it, laddie,&rdquo; he cried in a fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you got that gold?&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s face was
suddenly contorted with fierce bodily pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, and it&rsquo;s yours when we come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another glance showed the hanging party on the outskirts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
of the village. They were passing slowly. Peter
knew they would travel faster when the last house was
passed. Eve saw them, too, and her hands writhed in
silent agony as they clasped each other in her lap. She
turned again to stare helplessly at Elia. She must leave
him to Peter. Instinctively she knew that one word from
her might spoil all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wher&rsquo; are they now?&rdquo; asked the boy, his ghastly
face cold as marble after his seizure of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; out of the village. We&rsquo;ll be too late
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden the boy cried out. His voice was
shrill with a desperate fear, but there was a note of determination
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em. Come on, I ken walk. But
it&rsquo;s only for Jim, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want that gold.&rdquo; And
for the first time in her life Eve saw the boy&rsquo;s eyes flood
with tears, which promptly streamed down his ghastly
cheeks.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes glowed. There was just time, he believed.
But he was thinking of the boy. At last&ndash;&ndash;at
last. It was for Jim Elia was doing it. For Jim, and
not for the gold. He had delved and delved until at last
he had struck the real color, where the soil had long been
given up as barren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, laddie.&rdquo; He stepped up to the boy with a
great kindness, and, stretching out his herculean arms,
he lifted him bodily from the bed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t walk,
you&rsquo;re too ill. I&rsquo;ll jest carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he bore him out of the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>IN THE SHADOW OF THE GALLOWS TREE</h3>
</div>
<p>The creak of a saddle; the shuffling and rustle of
horses moving at a walk through the long prairie grass;
the sudden jolt of a wheel as it dropped from a tufty wad
to the barren sand intersecting the clumps of grass of which
the prairie is largely made up; the half-hearted neigh of
a horse, as though it were striving to break from under
the spell of gloomy depression which seemed to weigh
heavily upon the very atmosphere; these were the only
sounds which broke the gray stillness of dawn.</p>
<p>No one seemed to have words to offer. No one seemed
to have sufficient lightness even to smoke a morning pipe.
There were few amongst those riding out from Barnriff
who would not far sooner have remained in their beds,
amidst the easy dreams of healthy, tired nature, now that
the last moments of a man&rsquo;s life were at hand. There
were few, now that the heat and excitement of accusation
were past, but would far rather have had the easy thought
that they had been on the other side of the ballot. But
this was mere human sentimentality at the thought of
the passing of one man&rsquo;s life. This thing was necessary,
necessary for example and precept. A man had slain
another. He was guilty; he must die. The argument
was as old as the world.</p>
<p>Yet life is very precious. It is so precious that these
men could not rid themselves of the haunting ghost of
self-consciousness. They placed themselves in the position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
of the condemned, and at once depression wrapped
them in its pall, and, shrinking within themselves, all
buoyancy left them. A man had to die, and each man
felt he was instrumental in wresting from him that which
of all the world must be most prized. And in many the
thought was painful.</p>
<p>The gray world looked grayer for their mission. The
daylight seemed to grow far more slowly than was its
wont. Where was the ruddy splendor of the day&rsquo;s
awakening, where the glory of dawning hope? Lost,
lost. For the minds of these men could not grasp that
which lay beyond the object of their journey.</p>
<p>The long-drawn howl of the prairie scavenger broke
the stillness. It was answered by its kind. It was a
fitting chorus for the situation. But ears were deaf to
such things, for they were too closely in harmony with
the doings of the moment. The gray owls fluttered by,
weary with their night&rsquo;s vigil, but with appetites amply
satisfied after the long chase, seeking their daylight repose
in sparse and distant woodland hidings. But there
were no eyes for them. Eyes were on the distant bluff
to the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>Six men rode ahead of the buckboard. Smallbones
was on the lead. It was his place, and he triumphantly
held it. His was the office. Jim Thorpe had reached
the end of the one-way trail. And it was his to speed
him on&ndash;&ndash;beyond. The rope hung coiled over the horn
of his saddle. It was a good rope, a strong, well-seasoned
rope. He had seen to that, for he had selected it himself
from a number of others. The men with him were
those who would act under his orders, men whose senses
were quite deadened to the finer emotions of life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span></div>
<p>Those behind the buckboard were there to witness the
administration of the sentence passed upon the prisoner by
his fellow townsmen.</p>
<p>Doc Crombie drove the buckboard. And he watched
the condemned man beside him out of the tail of his eye.
Jim&rsquo;s attitude gave him relief, but it made him feel
regret.</p>
<p>They had passed the limits of the village when his
prisoner suddenly pointed with his bound hands at a pile
of soil rising amidst the level of the prairie grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Blunt&rsquo;s cutting,&rdquo; he said, with curious interest.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tracked the gold ledge from the head waters down
to here.&rdquo; His tone was half musing. It almost seemed
as though he had no concern with the object of their
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s crazy on that gold,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He
guesses too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. And for some moments there
was silence. Finally his answer came with a smile of
understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not crazy. You fellers are all wrong. Peter&rsquo;s
got the gold all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s welcome, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had no sympathy with any gold find at that
moment, and presently he looked round at his prisoner.
The man&rsquo;s indifference almost staggered him. He chewed
his wad of tobacco viciously. At that moment he hated
himself, he hated Jim, he hated everybody&ndash;&ndash;but most of
all he hated Smallbones.</p>
<p>After a while he spoke, and though his manner was
sharp he meant kindly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t told what, I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo;, you could tell, Jim,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
he said. Then he added significantly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nigh a
mile to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim was gazing out at the great arc of rosy light
growing in the eastern sky, and the doctor stirred impatiently.
At last the condemned man turned to him
with a grave smile&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s nothing so beautiful in nature as a perfect
summer dawn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It makes a man feel
strong, and&ndash;&ndash;good. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s dawn,&rdquo; he added, with
a sigh.</p>
<p>The doctor spat out his tobacco, and his lean hands
clenched tight on the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it makes you fool-headed, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it does,&rdquo; Jim agreed, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Maybe
it&rsquo;s good to be fool-headed once in a while. The fool&rsquo;s
generally a happy man.&rdquo; Then his eyes looked away in
the direction of Peter&rsquo;s cutting. &ldquo;And happiness, like
Peter&rsquo;s gold, takes a heap of finding,&rdquo; he continued a
moment later. &ldquo;Guess the wiser you are the harder
things hit you. And as you grow older it&rsquo;s so easy to
be wise, and so hard to be fool-headed. That bluff we&rsquo;re
riding to. Maybe it&rsquo;s foolish me riding to it. That&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;re thinking&ndash;&ndash;because you&rsquo;re wise. It makes
me glad I&rsquo;m fool-headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor unnecessarily slashed the horses with his
whip. But he was careful not to increase the pace.</p>
<p>Jim went on after a moment&rsquo;s pause, while he watched
the hawk-like mould of his companion&rsquo;s profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s a good friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Last night, if I&rsquo;d
said the word, he&rsquo;d have fought for me. He&rsquo;d have fought
for me till the boys shot him down in his tracks. And
he&rsquo;d have thought no more of giving his life for me than&ndash;&ndash;than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
Smallbones would think of taking mine. And
some of the gold he&rsquo;s looking for would&ndash;&ndash;have come his
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor looked round sharply. He began to wonder
if Jim were getting light-headed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; foolish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But the other shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t guess you know Peter as I do&ndash;&ndash;now.
I didn&rsquo;t quite know him&ndash;&ndash;before. I do now. Life&rsquo;s so
mighty full of&ndash;&ndash;well, the things we don&rsquo;t want, that it&rsquo;s
well to get out and look for something that don&rsquo;t seem
to be lying around. And every time you find one of
those things, it seems to set the things life wants you to
have farther and farther away. That&rsquo;s what Peter&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;
He smiled ever so gently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking for
what he calls gold. Guess I&rsquo;ll find some of Peter&rsquo;s gold&ndash;&ndash;in
yonder bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s eyes were staring out at their destination.
He had no answer. He caught something of Jim&rsquo;s meaning,
but his hard mind had not the proper power of
assimilation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that bluff was a thousand miles off, Doc, I still
shouldn&rsquo;t have anything in my fool-head to tell. Seems
to me a bit chilly. Couldn&rsquo;t we drive faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. By Gad, we couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver&rsquo;s words came with a sudden outburst of
passion. If half the silent curses he was hurling at the
head of the venomous Smallbones at that moment took
effect, the man would surely have then and there been
blotted out of the history of Barnriff.</p>
<p>Jim had no more to say, and the other had no
power to frame the thoughts which filled his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
And so a silence fell upon them as they approached the
woods.</p>
<p>Through the perfect fretwork of the upper branches
the eastern light shone cold and pure; in the lower
depths the gray gloom had not yet lifted. The dark
aisles between the trees offered a gloomy welcome.
They suggested just such an ending as was intended for
their journey.</p>
<p>The leaders had passed round the southern limits, and
were no longer in view. The doctor headed his horses
upon their course. Something of the eagle light had
gone out of his eyes. He stared just ahead of his horses,
but no farther. As they came to the bend, where Barnriff
would be shut off from their view, Jim turned in his
seat, and who can tell what was in his mind at the moment?
He knew it was his last glimpse of the place,
which for him had held so many disappointments, so
many heartaches. Yet&ndash;&ndash;he wanted to see it.</p>
<p>But his eyes never reached the village. They encountered
two objects upon the prairie, and fastened
themselves upon them, startled, even horrified. A large
man was running, bearing in his arms a strange burden,
and behind him, trailing wearily, but still running, was a
woman. He could have cried out at the sight, and his
cry would have been one of horror. Instead, he turned
to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reasonable request is denied a&ndash;&ndash;dying man,
Doc,&rdquo; he said, eagerly. &ldquo;Drive faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the other touched his horses with the
whip, and they broke from their amble into a brisk trot.</p>
<p>In half a minute they drew up in the shadow of a
great overhanging tree.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></div>
<p>Jim was promptly assisted to the ground by the waiting
men, for he was bound hand and foot. Now his
bonds were removed, and immediately he stepped forward
to where Smallbones had just succeeded in throwing
his rope into position overhead, and was testing it
with his own weight.</p>
<p>As the prisoner came up he turned, and a malicious
sparkle shone in his eyes as he confronted the calm
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll bear my weight?&rdquo; Jim inquired, coldly. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t be pleasant to go through it twice.&rdquo; He
glanced up at the tree as though interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s built fer ropin&rsquo; &lsquo;outlaws,&rsquo;&rdquo; Smallbones grinned.
&ldquo;I sure don&rsquo;t guess a low-down skunk of a murderer&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man never finished his sentence. Doc Crombie
had him by the throat in a clutch that threatened to
add another and more welcome crime to the records.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word from your lousy tongue an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll strangle
you!&rdquo; roared the doctor, venting at last all the pent-up
wrath gathered on the journey out.</p>
<p>But Jim was impatient. He remembered those two
toiling figures behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up, Doc,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;His words don&rsquo;t
hurt. Let&rsquo;s finish things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s hand fell from the man&rsquo;s throat and he
drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix the ropes,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>In silence four of the men advanced, while the evil
eyes of Smallbones savagely glowered at the doctor. In
a few moments Jim&rsquo;s arms were pinioned, and his ankles
bound fast. Then the rope was loosely thrown about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
his neck. And after that a man advanced with a large
silk handkerchief, already folded, and with which to
blindfold him.</p>
<p>But suddenly the doctor bethought him of something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he cried. Then he addressed himself directly
to the condemned man. &ldquo;Jim Thorpe, you sure
got friends present. You sure got friends ready to hear
anything you got to tell. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; this world
right now, actin&rsquo; a lie if not speakin&rsquo; one. Ther&rsquo; are
folks among us dead sure, or I wouldn&rsquo;t say it. Mebbe
you ain&rsquo;t thought that if this thing is done, an&rsquo; what I
suspicion is true, you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; murderers of us all&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; in
pertickler Smallbones. Say, you got your chance.
Speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men round the tree stood hushed in awe, waiting.
There was not a sound to break the stillness except the
soft rustle of the trees in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you all, I am innocent,&rdquo; Jim said firmly.
Then he shrugged. &ldquo;Guess you must take your own
chances what you are when this is done. We don&rsquo;t need
to wait any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the doctor signed to the man with the
handkerchief. The prisoner&rsquo;s face was pale, but his eyes
were steady and his lips firm. There was no weakness
in him, and the wondering crowd were troubled. Most
of them had seen hangings in their time, but they had
never seen a man face death in cold blood quite like
this.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while the bandage was being secured, one
of the younger men in the front rank threw up his arm
as though to ward off a blow. He covered his eyes, and
fled precipitately behind his comrades, where he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
no longer see. Several others turned their backs deliberately.
The whole thing was too terrible. It was hideous.</p>
<p>Doc Crombie stood with folded arms within two yards
of the prisoner. Behind the prisoner Smallbones and
the rest of his men stood, their hands grasping the plaited
rope. They were only awaiting the silent signal from
the doctor.</p>
<p>When the handkerchief had been adjusted the man
fell in beside his comrades on the rope. The awful moment
had arrived when the signal must be given. The
tension amongst the onlookers was breathless, and the
agony of the man about to die must have been appalling,
in spite of his apparent calm.</p>
<p>The moments passed. It almost seemed as though the
hardened nerve of the doctor needed support. At last
he stiffened. He raised his head, and looked squarely at
the pinioned man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Thorpe,&rdquo; he cried, in a harsh, unyielding voice.
&ldquo;You are condemned to die by the ballot of your fellow
citizens, for the murder of Will&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho, Doc! Hold on! For God&rsquo;s sake, hold
your hand, Doc!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great hoarse voice split the deathly stillness with a
roar that suddenly electrified the assembly. Everybody
swung round in the direction whence it came. That is,
everybody but the doctor. He had recognized the voice,
and he had caught Smallbones&rsquo; gleaming eye. With a
spring he was at Jim&rsquo;s side, and threw the noose clear of
his neck. He had no idea of the reason of the interruption,
but he had caught Smallbones&rsquo; eye.</p>
<p>He turned about in time to see Peter Blunt break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
through the crowd bearing in his arms the crippled
brother of Eve Henderson. Following close upon his
heels was Eve herself, gasping and almost fainting with
her exertion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>THE PASSING OF ELIA</h3>
</div>
<p>Peter Blunt paused, staggered, then with a great effort
pulled himself together. Mighty man as he was, he had
reached the limits of his strength, for he had run nearly a
mile, carrying Elia in his arms. Eve now clung to his
great arm for support.</p>
<p>Peter set the boy on his feet and supported him. A
great fear was in him that a perverse fate would yet rob
them of justice. Elia was dying, and he knew it. He
needed no examination to tell him so. It was there,
written in the glazing eyes, in the hideous blue pallor
stealing over the lad&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in time, laddie,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, with his
mouth close to Elia&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Speak up and say the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he looked up to encounter the keen eyes of the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; the latter demanded harshly. But
there was a sudden light of hope in his fierce eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;s got something to say. It&rsquo;s the truth
about the killing.&rdquo; Peter indicated the boy. &ldquo;Speak up,
laddie, they&rsquo;re all friends. Speak up&ndash;&ndash;for Jim&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
Eve looked on with hands clasped. She was still breathing
painfully from her exertions.</p>
<p>The crowd gathered round. All but Smallbones, who
never for a moment removed his eyes from Jim&rsquo;s face. It
was a bitter moment for him. He felt he was about to be
robbed of his prey, and he resented it with all that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
mean in him. But Elia did not speak. His eyes were
half closed, and a terrible helplessness seemed to have
suddenly seized hold of him.</p>
<p>Peter urged him again with a sinking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell them, laddie? Aren&rsquo;t you
going to tell them all you&rsquo;ve told me&ndash;&ndash;and save Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jim&rsquo;s voice that answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother the lad,&rdquo; he said. He could not see, but
instinctively he knew that Elia was in a bad way.</p>
<p>Peter caught at his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, laddie? That&rsquo;s Jim talking. You&rsquo;ve
come to tell the truth and save him. They&rsquo;ve got him all
bound up, and the rope&rsquo;s hanging over him. Eh? I
didn&rsquo;t rightly hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had seen the boy&rsquo;s lips move, and he strove by every
means in his power to encourage him to a dying effort.</p>
<p>But in the pause that followed Smallbones&rsquo; mean voice
was suddenly heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no sort o&rsquo; justice. Wot&rsquo;s these folks buttin&rsquo;
in fer? They&rsquo;ve stuffed him full o&rsquo; lies &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s sick an&rsquo;
dying. I tell yer it&rsquo;s a trick, an&rsquo; when he speaks it&rsquo;ll be to
tell his usual lies&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t lies, I tell yer it ain&rsquo;t lies.&rdquo; It was Elia speaking,
suddenly roused from his stupor by the vicious charge.
His words came in a high, shrill voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to
tell no lies. I killed Will Henderson. I killed him! I
killed him! He&rsquo;s kicked me to death, an&rsquo; I killed him with
Jim&rsquo;s knife. It was lyin&rsquo; ther&rsquo; wher&rsquo; he&rsquo;d left it after he&rsquo;d
fixed them rags on his face. I killed him, I tell yer.
An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m glad. &rsquo;Cos I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;hate him, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;killed&ndash;&ndash;me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s voice had risen to a shriek, and then died
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
suddenly away to a whisper as he fell back into Peter&rsquo;s
arms. It was the final effort, which Peter had been unable
to rouse him to, but which, to his own chagrin, Smallbones
had achieved.</p>
<p>The boy was dead. The one honest action of his life
had been performed with his last breath. Such was the
overmastering cruelty of his nature that, in comparative
health, and with all his faculties alert, the one spark of
good, somewhere deep down in his heart, had had no
power to shine. The flesh had been too strong for him&ndash;&ndash;and
now, now perhaps he had fulfilled his mission, and
that one little step forward would carry him beyond the
jaws of evil which had been so tightly shut about his poor,
weakly spirit. Peter laid him gently upon the ground.</p>
<p>Then he stood up about to speak. There were tears
in his eyes, and without shame he dashed them away
with the back of his hand. But Eve stayed him with a
gesture. She took a step forward. Her eyes were shining
as she glanced round upon the familiar faces. Her
mind was made up. There was no shrinking now at the
disgrace she had in her cowardice so feared before. Jim
had shown her the way to a loyal courage. She understood
now why he had gone to his death shielding the
real murderer. He had done it to save her, he had done
it as once before he had sought to help her. She loved
him, and no longer feared to tread the path he had so
willingly, so readily trodden for her sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you all the things that I should have
told you long ago,&rdquo; she began, in clear ringing tones, &ldquo;but
I couldn&rsquo;t, because&ndash;&ndash;because he was my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A startled sound went round the listeners. The
doctor&rsquo;s eyes flashed suddenly in Jim&rsquo;s direction. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
before she could continue, the latter suddenly urged her
to silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to speak of him, Eve,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Leave it to me, and I&rsquo;ll tell them how Will came by his
death&ndash;&ndash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the doctor interfered. He signed to one of the
men to release the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s story first,&rdquo; he said decidedly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll please get right ahead, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just the briefest possible hesitation. For a
second Eve&rsquo;s eyes wandered over the faces now gathered
so closely about. It was not that she was any longer
afraid. It was merely that she looked for one friendly
glance. She found it in the round face of Angel Gay.
He was smiling on her. And at once she plunged into
her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Henderson&ndash;&ndash;my husband, was the cattle-thief,&rdquo;
she said. And for a moment she could go no further.
Had she desired to create a sensation, she amply succeeded.
The doctor had to call for silence so that she
might proceed.</p>
<p>Having made the plunge, her story came clearly and
concisely. She told everything without sparing either herself
or her husband. She began from the time when Will
had been ordered out of Barnriff, and told all the pitiful,
sordid details, right down to his final return after escaping
from the doctor&rsquo;s men at the Little Bluff River.
Everything she told as she knew it, except the part Jim
had played in his actual escape. This she could not bring
herself to speak of.</p>
<p>The story took some time in the telling, but there was
not a man amongst those assembled that did not hungrily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
take in every detail of it. And as it unrolled, to the final
scene of Will&rsquo;s return, when again he ill-used her and departed
in search of Elia to kill him, and his final promise
to return later and kill her, a fierce light of understanding
grew on the swarthy, rough faces, and muttered imprecations
flew from lip to lip. All bitterness for Jim had
passed from their thoughts, all except, perhaps, from the
thoughts of Smallbones.</p>
<p>And Jim remained silent all the time. He, too, was
listening. He, too, shared again in the thoughts which now
assailed the others. The hideous brutality, as it appeared,
told in Eve&rsquo;s simple words, set his blood boiling afresh
against the dead man. Though he knew it all only too well,
it still had power to rouse the worst side of his nature.</p>
<p>At the conclusion, Doc Crombie suddenly turned to
Jim. He offered no comment, no sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I guess, you&rsquo;ll talk some,&rdquo; he said, in his usual
harsh tone. But somehow his words seemed to contain a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy has told you who killed Will Henderson,&rdquo;
Jim answered at once. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, because I didn&rsquo;t see him
killed. I&rsquo;ll tell you the part I had in the affair. It&rsquo;s not
pretty.&rdquo; He paused, but went on almost at once. &ldquo;I
happened along to Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s house directly I
came in to town. I had news for her. You know the
news. Will had escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Smallbones, unable to keep silent longer,
&ldquo;because you helped him, an&rsquo; bluffed the Doc. Oh, I&rsquo;m
wise to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look wise to a good deal,&rdquo; retorted Jim, with a
cold smile. Then without further concern he went on
with his story. &ldquo;I came to her house and found her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
bound and gagged. Will had not long left her. She
told me what had happened, that he had gone off to kill
Elia, and I rode out at once to the bluff. I found Will
kicking the life out of the poor boy. I jumped from my
horse and hit him with my fist. I frankly admit I desired
to kill him, and my whole intent was in that blow.
He fell to the ground with his jaw badly smashed, and&ndash;&ndash;and
I was glad. I left him there and looked to Elia. He
was in a pretty bad way, but he did not seem so bad as I
now realize he must have been. However, when I saw
that I had been in time to save him, my anger began to
pass, and I felt I could not leave the wretched man lying
there with his wound dripping, and&ndash;&ndash;well, I thought I&rsquo;d
better do what I could for him. So I sent Elia over to
my horse&ndash;&ndash;I intended that he should ride home&ndash;&ndash;while I
fixed Will&rsquo;s face up some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had nothing much to do it with except my
handkerchiefs,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;so I knelt down beside him,
took out my sheath-knife and ripped up my white handkerchief
into a bandage and folded my neck-scarf into a
pad, and bound it on his broken jaw. Then I got up,
and now I know I must have left my knife on the ground
beside him. I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. Anyway, I left
him and went back to my horse expecting to find Elia.
But he was not there. I was alarmed at once, and began
to search round for him, calling at the same time. You
see, I thought he&rsquo;d maybe collapsed somewhere near by.
But I got no answer, and so circling round and round I
again came to where Will Henderson was lying. At first
I didn&rsquo;t notice anything, it was fairly dark; then, of a sudden,
I saw he was lying on his back, where before he had
been on his side. The next thing was that I realized the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
bandages were off his face. Then, as I knelt down beside
him again, I found that&ndash;&ndash;other. My knife was sticking
up in his chest. Then I knew the reason of Elia&rsquo;s absence,
and&ndash;&ndash;what he had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim ceased speaking, and presently his eyes sought
Eve&rsquo;s face with a look of trouble in their dark depths. He
had wanted to spare her all this, and now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s voice was questioning him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you come right into the village, wher&rsquo; your flavor
was mighty strong, to tell us he was dead?&rdquo; he asked almost
incredulously.</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. All eyes were upon him, silently echoing
their leader&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t killed him. Besides,
what else was there to do? The evidence was damning
anyway. And I sure couldn&rsquo;t run away. I guessed I&rsquo;d
best trust to circumstances. Y&rsquo;see my last words to Mrs.
Henderson were a threat to kill her husband&ndash;&ndash;if he&rsquo;d
killed Elia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them things sure may have influenced you, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc Crombie turned at the interruption. It was Eve
who spoke. Her eyes were shining, and she looked fearlessly
into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, with rising emotion, &ldquo;I think I can
see the rest. It was to shield Elia, and, shielding him, to
save me from pain and the disgrace which he knew I was
too cowardly to face. He did it as he did that other
thing, when he set out to carry a warning to Will, simply
to help me, and save me from my troubles. Oh, doctor,
haven&rsquo;t you heard and seen sufficient? Must you stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
here demanding all the inmost secrets and motives of
two people&rsquo;s lives? Let us go. Let Jim go. I have
yet to bury my dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman suddenly turned to Peter and buried her
face against his rough flannel shirt, while the long-pent
tears at last broke forth, and her body shook with sobs.
Peter put his arm about her shoulders and patted her
gently with his great rough hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing is played right out, Doc,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got the facts. Let them be sufficient.&rdquo; He turned to
the boys, and his great kindly face was lit with something
like a derisive smile. &ldquo;Do you want a hanging, lads?&rdquo;
he asked them. &ldquo;Because, out of all this racket, it seems
to me there&rsquo;s only one needs the rope, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s Smallbones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He needed no other answer than the harsh laugh
which greeted his words. He had done it purposely. He
meant to clip Smallbones&rsquo; wings for him, and, at the same
time, put an end to the scene for Eve and his friend.</p>
<p>His success was ample. Doc Crombie walked straight
up to Jim Thorpe and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for things, Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t
rightly blame us. Not even Smallbones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim wrung his hand cordially, but silently. His eyes
were still on Eve at Peter&rsquo;s side. The doctor saw his
look and understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; right back to the city,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, authoritatively, &ldquo;I guess all you&rsquo;se
folks had best git busy that way, too.&rdquo; Then he turned
sharply and walked over to his buckboard. &ldquo;Smallbones,&rdquo;
he said, as he mounted to his seat, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll come
right along in with me&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; bring that rope.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>GOLD</h3>
</div>
<p>The gray of dawn had passed. Now the rosy light
of day was spreading its fresh beauty across the heavens,
and gladdening the warming air, and painting afresh
with generous brush the rolling, open world below.</p>
<p>Yes, the drab of dawn was past, and, as it was with all
Nature about them, the rosy light of hope brushed
lightly the weary hearts of those who had just passed
through the fiery trials of the furnace of despair.</p>
<p>There were three people only standing beneath the tree,
under whose shadow a man&rsquo;s life so recently was to have
been offered a sacrifice to human justice&ndash;&ndash;two men and
a woman. There was something else there, but life had
passed from it, and it lay there waiting, in the calm patience
of the last, long sleep, to return to the clay from
which it sprang.</p>
<p>Eve was kneeling beside the deformed body of her
poor brother. Her tears were falling fast as she bent
over the pale upturned face, even more beautiful still
since Death had hugged him to its harsh bosom. All
the woman&rsquo;s passionate love and regrets were pouring
out over the unconscious clay. His cruelties, his weaknesses
were forgotten, brushed away by an infinite love
that had no power nor inclination to judge.</p>
<p>She loved him, and he was dead. He was gone beyond
her ken; and for the moment in her grief she longed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
be with him. In the midst of her tears she prayed&ndash;&ndash;prayed
for the poor weak soul, winging its way in the
mysterious Beyond. She asked Him that his sins might
be forgiven. She prayed Him that the great loving forbearance,
so readily yielded to suffering humanity, might
be shed upon that weak, benighted soul. She poured
out all the longings of her simple woman&rsquo;s heart in a
passionate prayer that the Great Christ, who had shed
His blood for all sinners, would stretch out His saving
hand, and take her brother&rsquo;s erring spirit once again to
His bosom.</p>
<p>The two men stood by in silence. Their heads were
bowed in reverence. They, too, felt something of the
woman&rsquo;s grief.</p>
<p>But presently Peter Blunt raised his head. His kindly
blue eyes were full of sympathy. He moved across the
intervening grass, and laid a hand with infinite tenderness
upon the woman&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take him with us,&rdquo; he said gently.</p>
<p>The woman started, and looked up through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him? Take him?&rdquo; she questioned, without
understanding.</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him to&ndash;&ndash;his new home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve bowed her head and covered her eyes with her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s yours, Eve,&rdquo; the man went on softly. &ldquo;Shall
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded silently and rose to her feet.
Peter stooped and picked the boy up in his arms to carry
him as he had carried him before. Then he moved off
and Eve followed him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span></div>
<p>Jim hesitated for a moment. It almost seemed as
though he had no right to force himself upon the
woman&rsquo;s grief. It seemed to him like sacrilege, and
yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Finally he, too, joined in the silent procession.</p>
<p>They followed whither Peter chose to lead. There
was no question. It was not a moment for question.
The kindly heart dictated. It was only for the others
to acquiesce. Peter, too, perhaps in lesser degree, had
loved the boy. But then it was in his nature to love all
suffering humanity. He had never had anything but kindness
for Elia in life. Now that he was dead his feelings
were no less.</p>
<p>So they trailed across the prairie&ndash;&ndash;on, slowly and
solemnly on. Their course was marked straight as an
arrow&rsquo;s flight in Peter&rsquo;s mind. Nor did he pause till the
mound of gravel beside his cutting was reached.</p>
<p>He stood at the brink of the shallow pit. There in
its depths lay a broad, jagged, soil-stained ridge. Here
and there on its rough surface patches of dazzling white,
streaked with the more generous tints of deep red, and
blue, and green, showed where the hard-driven pick had
split the gold-bearing quartz.</p>
<p>Eve stared wonderingly down. Jim looked on in
silent awe. He knew something of that which was in
Peter&rsquo;s mind. Peter had found the deposits for which
he had so long searched. Here&ndash;&ndash;here was the great
reef, round which the Indian stories had been woven.</p>
<p>He laid his burden on the edge of the pit. Then he
clambered down into it. He signed to Jim, and the
waiting man understood. He carefully passed the boy&rsquo;s
body to the man below.</p>
<p>Then he stood up, and Eve came to his side. Silently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
she rested one hand upon his shoulder, and together they
watched the other at his work.</p>
<p>With the utmost tenderness Peter laid the boy down
on his gravelly bed. They saw that the dead lad&rsquo;s face
was turned so that its cheek rested against the cold,
auriferous quartz. Then the man untied the silk scarf
about his own neck and laid it over the waxen face.
Then he stood up and stripped the shoring planks from
the walls of the pit, and placed them a solid covering
over the boy&rsquo;s body, resting them on two large stones,
one at his head and one at his feet. Finally he tested
their solidity, and climbed out of the grave.</p>
<p>Now he joined the others, and gazed silently down into
the pit. For some moments he stood thus, until presently
he glanced across at the eastern sky. A fiery line, like
the light of a distant prairie fire, hovered upon the
horizon. He knew it was the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>He turned to the still weeping woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Eve,&rdquo; he said gently, pointing into the pit.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gold lies there. He wanted it, and&ndash;&ndash;and I
promised he should have it. Jim,&rdquo; he turned, and looked
into the dark eyes of his friend, &ldquo;that poor, weak, suffering
lad saved you, because&ndash;&ndash;because you&rsquo;d been good to
him. Well, old lad, I guess now that we&rsquo;ve found some
of the gold that lies here in Barnriff, we&ndash;&ndash;we must be
content. We mustn&rsquo;t take it with us, we mustn&rsquo;t rob
those who need. We&rsquo;ve found it, so we&rsquo;ll just cover it
up again, and hope and pray that it may multiply and
bear fruit. Then we&rsquo;ll mark it with a headstone, so that
others may know that this gold is to be found if folks
will only seek long enough, and hard enough beneath the
surface.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span></div>
<p>Jim nodded. He understood.</p>
<p>Then, as the great arc of the morning sun lifted above
the horizon, both men picked up the shovels lying close
by them, and buried forever the treasure Peter had
found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>ON, OVER THE ONE-WAY TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s door was suddenly pushed open. She did not
look up from her sewing-machine. She guessed who
her visitor was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Annie, dear,&rdquo; she said, cordially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
through with this in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her visitor took the proffered chair and smiled, while
the busy machine rattled down the last seam of the skirt
on which the other was busy.</p>
<p>Eve was very good to look upon, as she bent over
her work, and her visitor was well content to wait. Her
slight figure was delightfully gracious; her pretty hair,
loosely dressed, looked to have all the velvet softness and
lustre of spun silk. Her face was hidden, but the beautifully
moulded outline of her cheek was visible. There
was such a wholesome air of purpose in her attitude that
it was quite easy to imagine that the shadows of the past
had long since faded from her gentle eyes, that youth
had again conquered, now that those gray days had
lightened to the rosy summer of peace.</p>
<p>Something of this was passing through the man&rsquo;s mind
as he hungrily devoured the beauty, which for so long
had held him its slave.</p>
<p>It was nearly two months since the happenings which
had so nearly ended Jim Thorpe&rsquo;s earthly career. Two
months during which he had honestly struggled to regain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
that footing he had once held in the district. And now
the fall was advancing, and the hopes of winning through
with the people of the place seemed as far off as ever.</p>
<p>Prejudice still clung. Barnriff, willing enough to accept
his actual innocence on the double charges made
against him, still could not forget that he had helped the
real thief to escape. It mattered nothing to them that
in the end the man had died a violent death. He had
been helped to escape&ndash;&ndash;their justice. So there was no
employment of any sort in Barnriff for Jim Thorpe. And
Eve, too, was only completing orders which had been
placed with her weeks before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, raising her needle and removing
the stuff from beneath it. &ldquo;I hate it, and I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a smile to encounter the dark eyes
of Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; she cried, in a tone that should have made
him glad. &ldquo;Why, I thought surely it was Annie. But
there, I might have known. Annie would not have sat
silent so long. You see she was coming over for a gossip.
But I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s too early for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim noticed now that something of the old happy light
was in her eyes again. That joyous light which he had
not seen in them for nearly a year. What a wonderful
thing was youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her as I came along,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;She
said she&rsquo;d come <i>after</i> supper. She sent her love, and said
she was going to bring a shirt-waist to get fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear thing! It&rsquo;s the one thing that makes my
life here possible, Jim. I mean her friendship. She&rsquo;s the
only one in all the village that can forget things. I mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
among the women.&rdquo; She came round the table and sat
on its edge facing him, staring out of the window at the
ruddy sunset with eyes that had suddenly become
shadowed with regret. &ldquo;Men aren&rsquo;t like that, it seems
to me. They&rsquo;re fierce, and violent, and all that, but
most of them have pretty big hearts when their anger
is past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes smiled whimsically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess maybe I won&rsquo;t
contradict you, but it seems to me I&rsquo;ve learned pretty well
how large their hearts are&ndash;&ndash;in the last two months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;you can get no work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded. But he had no bitterness now.
He had learned his lesson from Peter Blunt. He had no
blame for the weaknesses of human nature. Why should
he have? Who was he to judge?</p>
<p>There was a silence for some moments. Eve continued
to gaze at the sunset. The glorious ever-changing
lights held her physical vision, but her mind was
traveling in that realm of woman&rsquo;s thought, whither no
mere man can follow it.</p>
<p>It was Jim who spoke at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come to&ndash;&ndash;to air troubles,&rdquo; he said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I came to tell you of two things. One
of &rsquo;em is Peter. He&rsquo;s packing his wagon. He goes at
sun-up to-morrow. He says he must move on&ndash;&ndash;keep
moving. He says all that held him to Barnriff is finished
with, so now there&rsquo;s nothing left but to hit the
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Peter!&rdquo; Eve murmured softly. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose
he means the gold business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; replied the man, without conviction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s eyes were widely questioning. The other
shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell. It&rsquo;s hard to get at what&rsquo;s passing
through his quaint mind. I don&rsquo;t think gold interests
him as much as you&rsquo;d think. Peter has plenty of money.
Do you know, he offered to advance me ten thousand
dollars to buy up a ranch around here. He pressed it on
me, and tried to make out it would be a favor to him if I
took it. Said I didn&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;d be obliging
him. He&rsquo;s a good man. A&ndash;&ndash;a wonderful man. I tried
to get him to stop on&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him for going,&rdquo; said Eve, regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that silence fell, and each was busy with thoughts
they neither could easily have expressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the other?&rdquo; Eve inquired presently. &ldquo;You
said&ndash;&ndash;two things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Oh, yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim did not at once tell her the other reason for
his visit. Instead he sat thinking of many things, and all
his thoughts were centred round her. He was thinking
the honest thoughts of a man who loves a woman so well
that he shrinks from offering her so little of worldly
goods as he possesses. He had come there, as a man
will come, to hover round and burn his fingers at the fire
which he has not the courage to turn his back upon. He
had come there to tell her that he was going away,
even as Peter was going&ndash;&ndash;going away to make one more
of those many starts which it had been his lot to make in
the past.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Eve faced him with smiling eyes. She understood
that his second reason was troubling him, and
she wanted to encourage him.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a scrap &lsquo;well,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, with an attempt at a
lightness he did not feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be so bad, as&ndash;&ndash;as some things,&rdquo; she said.
Her eyes had become serious again. She was thinking
of those two short months ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he breathed, with a sigh. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I suppose not.&rdquo;
Then with a desperate effort he blurted out his resolve.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away, too,&rdquo; he said clumsily.</p>
<p>His announcement cost him more than he knew. But
Eve showed not the least bit of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; she said. Then she added, as
though following out a thought which had been hers for
a long time, &ldquo;You see there are some things nobody
can put up with&ndash;&ndash;for long. Barnriff, for instance, when
it turns against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. Her understanding delighted him, and
he went on more easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve one hundred and fifty head of stock, and a thousand
odd dollars,&rdquo; he said deliberately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
make a fresh start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and somehow his laugh hurt the woman.
She understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh like that, Jim,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
not like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Eve,&rdquo; he replied in swift contrition. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but
it&rsquo;s not much, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to fancy it&rsquo;s quite a deal.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s face
wore a delightful smile. &ldquo;Where are you thinking of?&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come over to say that we, too, are going to hit the trail.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Canada. Edmonton. It&rsquo;s a longish piece off, but it&rsquo;s
good land&ndash;&ndash;and cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s British.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not under the &lsquo;stars and stripes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most flags are made of bunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A monarchy, too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monarchs and presidents are both men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s love for his flag was a sore point with him, and
he gathered that Eve disapproved. He wanted her approval.
He wanted it more than anything else, because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Suddenly
he remembered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s English,&rdquo; he said slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fervor of the woman&rsquo;s response was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see him to-night before he goes,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;because&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve got something to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down at the table on which the dress she
had just finished making was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last of them,&rdquo; she said, pointing at it.</p>
<p>The man knew what she meant. She had completed
her last order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do no more&ndash;&ndash;here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away,&rdquo; she said, with a shamefaced smile.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s what I want to tell&ndash;&ndash;Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim sprang to his feet, and looked into the bright
smiling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a sewing-machine,&rdquo; Eve went on, deliberately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
mimicking him, &ldquo;and&ndash;&ndash;and some dollars. And I&rsquo;m going
to make a fresh start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her manner of detailing her stock-in-trade, and the
smile that accompanied her words were good to see.
Jim&rsquo;s heart beat hard beneath his buckskin shirt, and the
light in his eyes was one of a hope such as he rarely permitted
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he demanded. But he knew before she
said the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canada, Edmonton. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a longish piece off&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eve never finished her mimicry. In a moment she
was in his arms, and her lips were silenced with his
kisses.</p>
<p>Some minutes later she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t let me finish, Jim,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>But he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest. We&rsquo;ll start in together,
up there, and&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll keep the sewing-machine for
home use. You see my socks &rsquo;ll sure need darning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly. You don&rsquo;t do that with a sewing-machine.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Peter&rsquo;s spring wagon was standing outside his door.
It was a quaint, old-fashioned vehicle&ndash;&ndash;just such a conveyance
as one would expect him to possess. It had
lain idle during most of his time in Barnriff, and had suffered
much from the stress of bitter winters and the blistering
sun of summers. But it still possessed four clattering
wheels, even though the woodwork and the tires
looked conspicuously like parting company.</p>
<p>The last of his household goods, with the exception of
his blankets, had been loaded up. There was a confused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
pile of gold-prospecting tools and domestic chattels.
Books and &ldquo;washing&rdquo; pans, pictures and steel drills,
jostled with each other in a manner thoroughly characteristic
of his disregard for the comforts of life. These
material matters concerned him so little.</p>
<p>He was scraping out a large frying-pan, the one utensil
which shared with his &ldquo;billy&rdquo; the privilege of supplying
him with a means of cooking his food. The work he
was engaged upon was something of a strain. It seemed
so unnecessary. Still, the process was his habit of years,
so he did not attempt to shirk it. But he looked up with
relief when he heard voices, and a glad smile of welcome
greeted Jim and Eve as they came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, we&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim and Eve both began to speak at the same time.
And both broke off to let the other go on.</p>
<p>Peter glanced swiftly from one to the other. His
shrewd eyes took in the situation at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;real glad. Jim,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I
guess your luck&rsquo;s set in. Eve, my dear, your luck&rsquo;s running,
too. I&rsquo;m just glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The culprits exchanged swift glances of astonishment.
Eve blushed, but it was Jim who answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you see things easy, Peter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
you aren&rsquo;t as glad as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; corrected Eve.</p>
<p>Peter bent over his work again, smiling at the friendly
pan with renewed interest. He scraped some long congealed
black grease from its shoulder and gazed at it
ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he said, with his quaint smile, holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
up the knife with the unwholesome fat sticking to it.
&ldquo;Guess your pans won&rsquo;t get like that, eh, Eve?&rdquo; Then
he added with a sigh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure time I hit the trail. It&rsquo;s
been accumulating too long already. Y&rsquo;see,&rdquo; he went on
simply, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing moving at times. Things need
cleaning once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw the pan into the wagon-box with a sigh of
relief, and turned again to his two friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask you to sit,&rdquo; he began. But Jim cut him
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need, old friend. We&rsquo;ve just come over
to say we, too, are going to hit the trail. We&rsquo;re going
to hit it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get the parson to marry us,&rdquo; Jim
went on eagerly, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;re going to hit out for
Canada&ndash;&ndash;Edmonton&ndash;&ndash;and start up a bit of a one-eyed
ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stood lost in thought, and Jim grew impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other nodded slowly, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully, but you&rsquo;ll need a wagon to drive you out&ndash;&ndash;when
you&rsquo;re getting married,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I
was thinking. Guess I&rsquo;ll drive you out in mine, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going at sun-up,&rdquo; cried Eve, in dismay.
&ldquo;We&ndash;&ndash;we can&rsquo;t get married so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll wait over,&rdquo; Peter answered easily. &ldquo;It
just means off-loading&ndash;&ndash;and then loading up again. My
frying-pan can have another cleaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old friend,&rdquo; cried Jim, linking his arm in
Eve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great feller. You&rsquo;ll see us&ndash;&ndash;married.&rdquo;
He squeezed the girl&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter looked away at the dying light. His eyes were
full of the kindly thought his two friends knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll just hit the trail again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man turned his face slowly toward them, and
his gentle humor was largely written in his expressive
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Canada, I guess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Edmonton&ndash;&ndash;it
seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
